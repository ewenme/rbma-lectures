Brian Fallon is a songwriting tour de force: ask Maria, Marilyn or Matilda. From his four albums with the Gaslight Anthem, to his soulful solo work and his Horrible Crowes side project, Fallon is one of the great storytellers of our time. Hailing from the working class streets of New Jersey, he’s very open about the influences he draws from, be they hometown or worldy. 
In a 2012 public interview with Red Bull Music Academy in New Jersey, Fallon discussed his influences, storytelling, recording in Nashville, and more.
RBMA 
Let’s welcome to the stage
Brian Fallon of the Gaslight Anthem. [applause]
Yeah. It’s good to see you.
Brian Fallon 
You too.
RBMA 
Did you come out of the kitchen there?
Brian Fallon 
I came out of the kitchen.
RBMA 
Back there making yourself a grilled cheese?
Brian Fallon 
Cooking something.
RBMA 
Very nice.
Brian Fallon 
Always cooking. Anybody want a Red Bull?
RBMA 
You’ve been back living in New Jersey for almost a year. Is it good to be
back?
Brian Fallon 
Yeah, yeah. That’s forced relocation though. I didn’t intentionally find
myself living in New York. I went on tour. I came back with an apartment that
I didn’t pick. It was in Brooklyn. I had to learn a zip code and everything.
[laughter]
RBMA 
Now you’re back here. Did you find the right pizza place in your neighborhood
and everything?
Brian Fallon 
No, I go to Brothers Pizza.
RBMA 
Very nice.
Brian Fallon 
I’ve been going there since I was little.
RBMA 
Right, right. I’m sure the folks over at Brothers will be very happy with
that.
Brian Fallon 
They don’t treat me that good.
[laughter]
RBMA
No?
Brian Fallon 
They don’t treat anybody that good.
RBMA 
That’s a shame, man.
Brian Fallon 
Good thin crust. Service is lackluster at best.
[laughter]
They should have been nicer ‘cause now it’s public. What are you going to do?
RBMA 
You did mention their pizza. They got to be pretty happy about that.
Brian Fallon 
I kind of did.
RBMA 
Guys like that, I don’t think they care that much. They got good pizza.
Brian Fallon 
I like that stuff with the olives in it, too. And the ham that they cut up?
It’s like a salad, but it’s antipasti. My uncle orders, I don’t order. He
always orders. I don’t know what it is. I get and I eat it. It’s nice. It’s
usually a Spanish girl that waits on us. She’s patient, I’ll give her that.
The hostess could be nicer.
[laughter]
RBMA 
This is a place that you’re going in and sitting down all the time, not just a
slice from the counter?
Brian Fallon 
No, I don’t get a slice from the counter. I want to soak in the atmosphere and
the local drunks, soak it all in. The sports games are not very good on there
either.
RBMA 
No?
Brian Fallon 
No. Anyway. I like the Yankees. You like the Yankees? [applause] Yeah. I just went to spring training. Derek Jeter, he looks OK, maybe a year
left. That’s about it. Mariano Rivera snaps that ball like a champ. Alex
Rodriguez is a bum. Golden Glove winner Curtis Granderson’s my man. I’m sorry,
I hijacked your interview.
[laughter]
RBMA 
This couldn’t be going any better as far as I’m concerned. I got boring
questions. This stuff is great.
Brian Fallon 
Going great in my mind.
RBMA 
This stuff’s great.
Brian Fallon 
Yeah, maybe tomorrow. I’m not going to think it was so good though when I see
the video tape. Can we play back the first 15 seconds? [looks behind at RBMA sign] I just noticed that’s nice.
RBMA 
Some of your words up there.
Brian Fallon 
Is that mine? I’ve never recognized my words. People send them to me all the
time. People feel the need to send me my own words. I appreciate it. It means
something to them. At the same time it’s creepy.
[laughter]
That’s it.
RBMA 
People send me my words sometimes, but only because they’re wrong.
Brian Fallon 
What did you say?
RBMA 
Just if I get something wrong. I’m a writer so they always tell me, “Hey, this
thing, this is wrong. You know this whole rest of the thing, this is OK. But,
this one thing is wrong and I take real issue with it.”
Brian Fallon 
Punctuationally or otherwise?
RBMA 
Just usually something like, “You wrote something about my neighbor and I
don’t really like it.” Something like that. Just amazing New Jersey stuff.
Brian Fallon 
My neighbors find my address and send me letters and they think that’s cool.
RBMA 
People right on your street?
Brian Fallon 
No, people from the town. One guy sent me a letter. He said, “I work for the
town so I got your address.” So I have two big dogs now, big pit bulls for real.
For real. They’re real nice dogs, but they’ll mess you up if you come in my
house.
RBMA 
Fair enough. Let’s talk a minute about New Jersey. I think we get this
reputation around the world for being an awful place. People land in Newark
airport. They come out of the city. They get on the turnpike there. They see
that Linden Co-Generation plant. They see the smoke stacks over here. Somebody
cuts them off from three lanes over. They take this mental snapshot. They’re,
“That was New Jersey. I’ve seen it.” That’s the thing that they carry with
them and they tell their friends all about it. But I think we’re also
developing a rep for being some hard workers. You’ve done a little hard work.
Brian Fallon 
Yeah, there’s a picture of me on the Internet fixing my door.
[laughter]
I’m serious. It was from last week. I didn’t find that funny either. I had
this screen door. I live in an older house. I got a friend who lives in
Bradley Beach and he’s my role model for houses. I listened to what he said. I
bought a house that looks just like his house. Except for my screen door
doesn’t work. It’s heavy and it ripped out. Four screws came out. I found out
that whoever drilled it in it was crooked. They went like this in. It was
really interesting. I was fixing my screen door. There’s a picture of me on
the Internet fixing my door. I don’t know if I got a drive by or I don’t know
how. I didn’t take that picture myself, man.
RBMA 
You doing work?
Brian Fallon 
Yeah.
RBMA 
Good street cred.
Brian Fallon 
It’s street cred, but it’s also creep cred.
[laughter]
Somebody’s a weirdo. There’s baby pictures of me on the Internet. I was a
baby, man. Leave me alone.
[laughter]
I’m just like you. I don’t want to be bothered at the 7-Eleven either from New
Jersey. You know what I mean?
RBMA 
Absolutely. Tell me a little bit about this work ethic. It’s a real point of
pride that we can fix our own doors in New Jersey.
Brian Fallon 
Yeah, yeah. That’s how a lot of us, at least the people I know were raised. No
one’s going to give you anything. You got to go get it. There’s probably a lot
more people with their opportunities that have had a lot more chances than
anybody I know. They went to the right schools and they had the right last
name or whatever. They expect things to come to them. It’s just people that I
know. They’ve had a certain sense of, “I expect this to go because I’ve got
the right credentials.” My friends and I never had the right credentials. It
was just you had to do it. You had to just do it yourself. Hopefully somebody
would notice. If you made enough noise they would. While you’re waiting to get
noticed you have to do other things. You get good with your hands. My hands
are still chapped up. I still know how to work. No matter what I do and no
matter where we go I think that stays with you. That’s a good thing to keep
with you. It helps you stay grounded and not ordering green M&Ms and
freaking out like Van
Halen. I like Van Halen. Everybody knows the
green M&Ms story. “Panama” is cool. I never been to Panama but I like the
song.
RBMA 
You’re a guy who has done some work. We’re talking about…
Brian Fallon 
Some?
RBMA 
You’ve done some work.
Brian Fallon 
Yeah. I worked on the Dave Franklin construction organization for a little
while.
RBMA 
I just want to skip the rest of these questions and just hear about that.
Brian Fallon
Actually, no, seriously the thing was when we started out, we didn’t make any
money. It was tough. When we came home from a tour that was it; that was your
money. It’s gone. You’re paying your gas. You’re working ahead of time. Then
you would save up that money and go on tour with it and pay for your gas and
pay for your tolls on tour. Pay for your food and your hotels or whatever or
you’re staying with your friends. Then you’d come home. You’d have to call
maybe two weeks before you got home from tour. You always find me on phoning
my friend Matty. I’d be like, “Matty, you got any work? You know you need
anything done? I’ll shine your shoes or whatever.” Those guys, my friends,
they kept me employed. They kept me able to feed myself and able to continue
on in my band. I know for a fact that they didn’t need me. I couldn’t really
do anything. They would always find something for me to do. They would always
keep me working. Not only does it keep you having food on the table and being
able to pay your bills but it also keeps a sense of pride where you don’t have
your family or your wife telling you, “What are you doing with your life?
You’re 26/-7/-8/-9 years old. And you, you don’t [work].” I know that’s funny.
When you’re trying to be a musician, it’s funny. Your dad gets real serious
when you’re 29-years-old and you want to be a musician. College is different.
It’s not an acceptable thing. It seems like a young guy. If my kid was 29 and
he was like, “Guess what? I’m gonna be a musician, dad.” And the only place
he’s playing is his room, I’m going to thump him. That’s for real. You don’t
have your family looking down on you like, “What a bum. You know, he’s not
doing anything.” Getting worried about you like, “You know what’s he gonna do
with his life?” These people really helped me out. That comes from that kind
of thing too. Everybody has that work ethic where they know, “Look, this is
all we’ve got.” You got to help out your buds. You got to try and keep them
afloat too.
RBMA 
Right. You’ve obviously taken that with you, that ability to overcome those
hurdles. You came out with three Gaslight album records in four years. You did
a complete tour cycle with each one. You did the Revival
Tour. You found time to release
this record with The Horrible Crowes. When do you sleep?
Brian Fallon 
At night. [laughs] I sleep but I got to work. I got to do this. I don’t know
if it’s going to be here forever. I don’t know if five years or two years from
now that any of you guys are going to come and see me yap for 45 minutes or
whatever. You’ll be here. You got a job. You got a good job. You’re a writer.
With me it’s popular opinion. My whole livelihood is based on popular opinion.
When I was in high school I was very temperamental, very temperamental. You’ve
got to keep that because the minute that you get that sense of “I’m here and
it’s OK,” that’s when you end up putting out the bad albums.
RBMA 
You get too comfortable.
Brian Fallon 
Yeah, you put out the no good records. There’s a lot of those. A lot of guys
who kind of said, “Well, you know I could do it on my own. I don’t need
anybody.” It doesn’t work.
RBMA 
I don’t think anybody has ever called a writer a good job decision before.
Thank you. I really appreciate that.
Brian Fallon 
I think doing whatever you want to do and making that happen. I got a friend
who wants to be a writer right now. He wants to write books. He always says,
“You know, I can’t wait to be a writer, but right now I gotta work for UPS,”
or “I gotta work for whatever.” The thing is is you are a writer, you’re only
UPSing on the side. That’s what you’re doing to pay your bills. You’re a
writer. Just do it. That’s the thing that keeps you going is that you if you
know, “I’m going to do this,” everyone will tell you no and that you can’t do
it and you’re no good at it. But you have to be honest with yourself. If
you’re lousy at it, don’t do it. I don’t want to read it. If you’re good at
it, then do it.
RBMA 
Absolutely.
Brian Fallon 
You know? [applause]
RBMA 
I know, I know. When this thing’s over I actually got to get behind the bar
and pull some pints for a little while. Tell me about this decision to record
in Nashville.
Brian Fallon 
Nashville came up because being from New Jersey we thought it’d be cool.
We’re, “Nashville, country music, OK. That’s got to be cool. There’s got to be
some mojo going on down there. We don’t know anybody. Nobody’ll bother us.” We
made the last record in New York. Everybody bothered us. All our friends were
coming by. People think musicians; they come to your work all the time. I
don’t sit on anybody’s desk on Monday morning. Why are you bothering me, man?
It’s weird. I’m trying to concentrate here. I know it looks like tomfoolery,
but it’s not. That’s why we picked Nashville. We were like, “It’s far enough
to where if somebody’s house is on fire, we can catch a quick plane back
home.” Fourteen hours is a long way to drive, you got to really be dedicated,
so nobody showed up, which is good. That’s Nashville. That’s why we picked
Nashville.
RBMA 
Nice, yeah. Did you get your hands dirty in a little bit of the history down
there?
Brian Fallon 
I looked at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, I thought about going. Or the
Country Music Hall of Fame, I thought about going there a lot, but I didn’t
go. We were busy. It was a good time. Apparently, Rick Springfield played one
of the nights. I said, “What’s he going to do? He’s going to play ‘Jessie’s
Girl’ and then I’m gonna leave.” That’s it. No, no, I didn’t really do
anything. Made a record, that was it.
RBMA 
What I’d like to do now is play a short little clip from the record, The ‘59
Sound, “Film Noir.”
We’re just going to listen to this real quick, the middle of the song.
(music: Gaslight Anthem – “Film
Noir” / applause)
All right, you got the idea. You get the idea because you wrote it.
Brian Fallon 
It’s been a minute since I’ve heard that.
RBMA 
I play that because go back to 2007, Asbury Lanes. I had just written a review
of your first record, Sink or Swim. We went out to the car to get the magazine I
was going to show you and at the time you were really more excited about
writing the next record already. You were so excited. You told me, “We’re going
to bring together Sam Cooke and Hot Water Music.” I was like, “That’s insane.
What is that? I don’t even know what that means.” And I think you really did.
Do you feel like you’ve achieved that sound?
Brian Fallon 
I do. On that record in particular we achieved exactly what we were going for.
I’m not sure that we knew what we were going for when we did it. We were going
for something and we definitely got it. I think everyone was equally surprised
and not surprised. Because we knew we had something when we were doing it. We
were chasing something for a really long time. That was the coming together
point of everything. That’s the point where I based all future work off of,
whether is it as good as that or is it? Sometimes the answer was no. Sometimes
the answer was yes. That was the big moment. Probably right around the time
that you’re talking about there was a little buzz going on between the four of
us. We knew we were on to something but we didn’t know if anybody would
receive it or what would they think. Was it too weird for 2008 at the time?
But it worked.
RBMA 
That’s fine. I feel the Gaslight Anthem is always mentioned in the context of
your influences. If we do a quick little exercise here. I’d like to throw out
a few artists and maybe you tell me what inspiration that you’ve drawn from
each one of them. Can we do that?
Brian Fallon 
Yeah.
RBMA 
All right, cool. We’ll start with an easy one. Start with The Clash.
Brian Fallon 
That’s a big stylistic thing with us. The Clash was a fundamental band for us
as far as a lot of people that come from a punk rock scene or anything like
that, you’re always told that you can’t succeed. You’re not allowed to. It’s
wrong to win. You can’t win. You’re supposed to be the beautiful losers like
The Replacements or one of those bands who kind of messed it up but kind of
didn’t. The Clash said, “No! We’re going to go play on top of Radio City Music
Hall. We’re The Clash. What are you talking about? We’re going to be the
biggest band in the world. We’re going to be The Who.” That was Joe
Strummer.
I dare you to find something wrong with Joe Strummer’s ethics. That was my
man. He still is. That’s my guy.
RBMA 
All right.
Brian Fallon 
Ethically. I don’t listen to reggae music though. That part of the thing,
leave that.
RBMA 
How about Greg Dulli, Afghan Whigs?
Brian Fallon 
A guy that I like a lot, but don’t necessarily want to be like. You don’t want to emulate Greg Dulli. Got himself into a few troubles. Greg Dulli was a poet, but he was unafraid to
say the things that regular people thought and you’re not supposed to say. I
think having that at such an early age, the Afghan Whigs, when I was maybe 12
or 13 shaped a lot of the thoughts that I had about what you can do as a band
and what you can say. That definitely brought me into the soul music side of
it. I know everybody says that they had Sam Cooke records when they were 10,
but that’s not true. I would listen to the Afghan Whigs and they would cover
these songs. They would cover “Come See About Me” and I would find out about
Diana Ross and The Supremes. From their little records that they had, mostly
EPs and 7”s that they did and live footage, whatever I could find. That was a
big part of me finding soul music. I would say that Greg Dulli and then mixed
with the Joe Strummer and everything else, that’s what led me to where I
eventually would go.
RBMA 
How about Morrissey?
Brian Fallon 
Not so much with me. No.
RBMA 
How about the rest of the band?
Brian Fallon 
Yeah, Alex in particular loves The Smiths, Alex Rosamilia. I listen to The
Smiths. There’s too much tape on the body, shirts off and roses in the teeth.
It wasn’t my thing. I get it.
[laughter]
He’s got nice hair. He’s got a cool voice. I guess he gets the chicks, but he
doesn’t care, does he?
[laughter]
I don’t know. He says he doesn’t like boys or girls. I don’t know, what do you
like? TV?
[laughter]
Red Bull?
RBMA 
Maybe we should be talking about your prior work experience.
Brian Fallon 
I don’t know. Morrissey’s cool, I don’t want to diss the guy. I like him. As
far as if I shook hands with him, that’d be cool. I would talk to him. I would
be, “You need to get over it and get The Smiths back together though. That’s
what seriously...” Johnny Marr, did you hear what he said recently?
RBMA 
I haven’t.
Brian Fallon 
He goes, “We’ll get The Smiths back together when the English government
surrenders...”
RBMA 
I did hear that, yeah.
Brian Fallon 
“… control.” I’m, “You’re a crazy person and you dress like a kid, man.
You’re not young no more.”
[laughter]
RBMA 
How about Pearl Jam?
Brian Fallon 
I love Pearl Jam. That’s my favorite band. That’s my guys. Those guys, I don’t
know, man. That was my music. I didn’t find that because of my mom or because
of my friends. I found that because that was my generation’s music. That was
our thing. That was different than everything else, Nirvana, and Soundgarden
and Pearl Jam. Those are the bands that you being a punk rock kid you weren’t
allowed to like. I was, “What are you talking about? I like Pearl Jam, that’s
a good band and they have long hair and they wear flannel shirts and I
wear...” All of a sudden I was cool. My grandmother had been dressing me in
flannel since I was six. Everybody was making fun of me. All of a sudden I was
so cool. I was, “Thanks, Eddie Vedder, that’s cool.” I don’t know, man. He was
different. Everybody was singing with this high voice. He comes in with this
low Jim Morrison thing. They changed all throughout the years. They always
kept you guessing. What’s your next record going to sound like? What are they
going to do? Am I going to hate it? I got a ukulele now. I don’t know. I don’t
know. Can you hang? That’s what their whole deal is, can you hang with us?
We’re not going to give you the same stagnant thing over and over. We’re not
going to play “Jeremy” for 10 years. We’re not going to give you that record
over and over again ‘cause you already have that record. I like that as an
artist. I probably would hate that as a fan. But I don’t I buy their records
and I love them. I stuck with them even through the weird periods.
RBMA 
That’s good of you. How about Jawbreaker?
Brian Fallon 
Yeah, Pearl Jam really appreciates me staying with them.
[applause]
Jawbreaker’s good. Jawbreaker, there’s a couple bands where people think,
everybody, the Internet’s probably going to go bananas. Jawbreaker and The
Replacements, they’re all right. They’re OK. Whoa, OK, all right, that’s cool.
Guess what? They didn’t sell that many records because people didn’t like them
that much. They got a couple good songs. It’s true. That’s what I think. You
came here to hear what I think. I’ll listen to you later. That’s what I think.
[laughter / applause]
RBMA 
The Punk News server just exploded when you said
that.
Brian Fallon 
I don’t care. “Yo, Punk News, The Replacements aren’t that good.”
[laughter / applause]
They got a song called “Tommy Hates Music” because it’s got too many notes.
That’s cool. The thing about those bands is Jawbreaker and The Replacements
is when they were on, the reason that people think that they’re so great and
that they’ve survived, and the reason that I have 10 of their songs on my iPod
is because when they were great, they were better than anyone. But 90%
of the time they were awful. That’s the thing. Without songs like “Tommy Hates
Music,” a song like “Unsatisfied” wouldn’t be as good. And that I didn’t think
of myself, I read that in Rolling Stone Magazine.
[laughter]
I did one time. Those kind of bands, I mean, I bought it. I liked it when I
was a kid. Then as I got older, especially now, I got a little sour on those
things. I’m just, no.
RBMA 
How about if we shift over to Mark Knopfler?
Brian Fallon 
Dire Straits, see, that’s what I’m talking about though. Dire Straits, that’s
a killer guy, killer musician. He knows his background. I’m not saying that
any of these other guys don’t but I think there’s some depth to a Dire Straits
kind of band. Where, I don’t know, man. I sat there for probably three months
trying to learn “Sultans of Swing” on the guitar. That’s all I would play for
three months. Even still, that kind of stuff inspires me. There’s a song
called “On Every Street.” I think that’s one of the finest written songs in
the world. He’s talking about somebody that he misses and he hasn’t seen in a
couple years and he lost track of that he’s looking for on want ads. That’s
pretty profound.
RBMA 
Since we’re right in the area, how about the Bouncing Souls?
Brian Fallon 
One of the best bands ever, period.
[applause]
That’s what I’m talking about. Don’t talk to me about The Replacements. Talk
to me about the Bouncing Souls. That’s a band who’s been around for 20 years
that has released great songs. I don’t know, what have they got? About 100
records out? They’re good. They’re really good. They’re continuing to give you
something different. They haven’t bought into their own nonsense and joined
Guns N’Roses. You know what I’m talking about. You can be a band like that.
That’s a band who fundamentally we’re different than. We want to go big. I
want to play Giants Stadium. They wanted to stay what they were. They always
stuck to it. They never listened to anybody else. The best thing about Mike,
and Greg, and Pete, and Brian is that they’re honest guys. You’ll never ever
hear them say a bad word about another band, ever. They’re never trying to
step on anybody’s back to get where they were. They just were, “We’re the
Bouncing Souls. We drink beer. We wear Adidas.”
[laughter]
RBMA 
Take anything from The Pogues?
Brian Fallon 
Don’t drink too much.
[laughter]
No, yeah. The Pogues are a good band. I love The Pogues. I still do. There’s a
lot of bands in that genre that unless you change that genre a little bit,
you’re just trying to be The Pogues. It doesn’t work out so good. They have
inspired some really cool bands. When you go, and the interpretations that
have come from the Pogues and the lineage that they’ve left, if you go to a
Dropkick Murphys show and you see them ever do a Pogue song, it’s mind-blowing. It’s so intense the way that these songs translate. You got this big
punk rock band, then you have these Irish folk songs. Shane McGowan’s a train
wreck. He wrote the most beautiful songs in the world. That’s the thing, man.
That’s the one thing that Paul Westerberg has, too. It’s they write those
songs that change peoples’ lives. Then they write a bunch of weird stuff too.
RBMA 
All right.
Brian Fallon 
He did a duet with Sinead O’Connor one time.
RBMA 
How about your mom? What inspiration did you take from her?
Brian Fallon 
My mom, she was a gospel singer. Yeah, she sang in church. She wasn’t like
Odetta or anything. Yeah, she sang in the church. She had a group, I think
around here in the Red Bank. Her and her friends had a little folk group and
they used to sing. They got two records. I don’t know how that happened or
where they were; whether they were in stores or what the real deal was. I
haven’t really dug too deep with her. But, yeah, she’s a singer. My mom played
The Monkees and Jesus when I was a kid. That was it, “Amazing Grace” and
“Daydream Believer,” that made me realize that music was awesome. That was it.
RBMA 
Thank you for doing that with me.
Brian Fallon 
Yeah, sure.
RBMA 
A few years ago, you were playing a solo show at the church, First Unitarian
Church out in Philly. There’s a guy out in the back of the room. He’s just
screaming, “Bruce, Bruce.” He had probably been tailgating at an Eagles game
all day. He still had some cheese steak dribbling down his chin and
everything. And you stopped dead in your tracks and you were like, “Hey, man.
I got my own songs.” That was a pretty incredible moment. Especially recently
you guys have, as a band, come past that point of the constant association
with that.
Brian Fallon 
I don’t know. JBJ’s been 30 years and he can’t get away from it. The guy’s the best.
You can’t take it away from him. You, Bruce and Elvis and The Beatles, that’s
it, man. You can’t get better than that. There’s a certain humility to finding
out that a guy like that likes your songs. Wanting to get away from it is a
purely artistic thing. It’s not a, “Oh, get away from me.” That’s the best
thing in the world to have is that embracement from a guy like that. It’s just
because I don’t want to walk in to a store and apply for the job and get it
because five minutes earlier my dad went in there and gave him 50 bucks. I
don’t want you to come to Giant Stadium because Bruce told you to. I love
Bruce. If you did show up, that’d be cool. Somehow it would feel like it
wasn’t really mine. That’s something that we have to earn. That’s not
something we have to shy away from. It’s something we definitely have to earn.
That’s going to take time. But on the other hand, too, I don’t mind. He’s
pretty decent. People say I remind them of him. I’ll take that. Why not?
RBMA 
If someone were to tell the story of the Gaslight Anthem history, it would
seem like four boys playing punk music, New Brunswick basement scene. You
guys, as you came out of that and matured, you discovered soul music, folk
music, blues, and a wider spectrum of rock. But you particularly had a pretty
long history with Americana even before you were coming out of those
basements.
Brian Fallon 
I did and that was something that I didn’t know what to do with. A lot of the
music that I had listened to when I was younger I didn’t really know where
that fit in with punk rock. Like I was saying, there’s a lot of rules put on
that. Bands like The Bouncing Souls and there’s Against Me! or Lucero or those
kind of bands, they were a little bit ahead of us. They broke that ground
where you could say, “You know maybe the first was...” I can’t even say who
the first was. I don’t know. There was a lot of bands. There was even
Lifetime, who did something a little different where it was a little off
kilter from what you were supposed to do. There’s a lot of rules for punk
rock. I don’t if you guys know about that. All the anarchy and stuff is very
confusing because there’s so many rules that go along with all the
rulelessness. That Sons of Anarchy’s pretty good though. I watched four
seasons in two weeks. I want to join a motorcycle gang.
[laughter]
I’m going to clean up the clubhouse. That’s what I’ll end up doing.
RBMA 
How do you look in that cut? In that motorcycle cut.
Brian Fallon 
Yeah, that scary. I don’t like words like that, cut. Like what do you got to
do get a cut? Could you be in a gang? I don’t think I could.
RBMA 
I don’t think so, no.
Brian Fallon 
No, me neither. I’m a chicken.
RBMA 
I don’t think so. You certainly write about your own experiences. At the same
time you have become an amazing storyteller. I could think of 10 people in
this room who are carrying on the tradition of storytelling whether it’s
through art, music, writing, photography. It’s a great tradition especially in
our area. How do you make something that’s so personal into something that’s
so universal?
Brian Fallon 
I think the misunderstood understand the best. The people that go through high
school and college and they feel; they’re just the kids that nobody
understands. They’re the ones looking at everything because nobody’s looking
at them. They have time to process that kind of thing. Loneliness is a funny
companion when you’re young. That’s when you’re forming your ideas about the
world. When you’re just on the outside, maybe not even so much that you get
picked on, but just because you don’t even get noticed for that, you have a
lot of time to watch the world. You get to form an opinion. You really learn,
if you’re paying attention, how people react. Once you join the workforce and
you find out that there’s other guys just like you that have lived, and this
goes for people who were popular too, it’s not this exclusive club. “Look at
me, I got so downtrodden that you rise above,” or whatever. Everybody’s got
that. It’s common. That’s why they call it the common man, songs of the common
man. It’s everyone. Everyone understands that, from bankers to the street
sweeper. They get it. I don’t even think there is street sweepers any more,
but it sounded cool, didn’t it?
[laughter]
RBMA 
They got a truck that does that now.
Brian Fallon 
That’s a cred word. There’s cred words. Did you know that, singer, songwriter
cred words?
RBMA 
Couple of points there, a couple cred points.
Brian Fallon 
Like troubadour, troubadour, flannel. You know what I love? I love the word I
heard on the way down here, the word “troubadour” in a Billy Joel song.
There’s two versions. There’s the Steve Earl version in the Talladega
Nights, the last of the hardcore troubadours. Then there’s Billy Joel where
he said, “Say goodbye to Hollywood.” That song, which no one would think of
Bob Dylan and that kind of thing in that. He says the word troubadour. I
thought that was funny.
RBMA 
All right. Learning all sorts of stuff tonight.
Brian Fallon 
I got more if you want.
RBMA 
You are a wealth, you are a wealth...
Brian Fallon 
I’m a wealth of something.
RBMA 
We’re going to wrap it up with this one. Everybody said the world was going
end in 2012, right? I hope it doesn’t ‘cause there’s so many great albums
coming out this summer. You guys have an album coming out. Tim Barry, Hot
Water Music, The Souls, Neil Young. I heard talk of a new Black Star album
possibly. What albums are you most excited about right now?
Brian Fallon 
You just said them. You took them all. You took everything.
RBMA 
Sorry.
Brian Fallon 
Greedy. It’s a greedy list. That’s a good list. The Mayans didn’t invent the
Internet, why do they know everything?
[laughter]
Seriously, you couldn’t even get ESPN in Mayan town.
[laughter]
How are you going to watch the sports ball?
RBMA 
No idea, Yankees box scores, huh?
Brian Fallon 
No, they don’t have it. You couldn’t see them when they have a good game or a
bad game. Mayans don’t know anything. Calendar. Who reads a calendar? I don’t
have a calendar. I have an iPhone, stupid Mayans. [laughs]
[laughter]
If the world blows up, the Mayans are not going to be kind to me. That’s cool.
I got stuff to do. The world can’t end, I got stuff to do. Mayans. I learned
about that in fourth grade, in the history book. It’s a big one, blue book.
They said the Mayans and the Mayan calendar just stops. Maybe because they
died of something like penicillin would’ve cured. Maybe you should’ve worried
that instead of doing a calendar. One Mayan was like, “Yo, the world’s gonna
end in 2012.” Other dude’s like, “I don’t care, man. I got pneumonia. I got
bit by a mosquito. I need some penicillin, you know.” They didn’t even have
shoes. Get out of here. Come on, Mayans.
[laughter]
RBMA 
All right. Is there any chance that you want to play [a few songs for us]?
Brian Fallon 
I’m on a space oddity.
RBMA 
Are you done?
Brian Fallon 
Two thousand twelve.
RBMA 
Are you done insulting civilizations now?
Brian Fallon 
I don’t care.
RBMA 
Maybe you can play a few songs for us?
Brian Fallon 
I’m not going. I can’t. I ‘m going to write a civilization song between the...
Yes, I’m not insulting anybody who... Nobody’s Mayan any more.
[laughter]
Come on. People are too sensitive, too. People are real sensitive nowadays. I
want to talk about that for a little minute, just a hot minute more.
RBMA 
Go ahead.
Brian Fallon 
I’m not going anywhere. You got to ask some questions about it. You’re the
writer.
RBMA 
It sounds like it’s hitting a nerve there.
Brian Fallon 
I got things I got to do. I’m sure everyone else in this room does too. I
don’t know. I just don’t like hype. I don’t like this terroristic news thing.
“Something you do every day is going to kill you and your kids and more at 8
PM.” It’s like 10 in the morning. You’re like, “What if I die between now and
8 PM if it’s going to kill me?” Everything is so fear-motivated. The world’s
going to end. Oh, OK, all right, OK. I’m still going to play my Xbox tonight.
All right, because somebody said so. Nobody wants to believe in anything
normal like treating people good and voting for the guy who’s not going to lie
to you. Nobody wants to focus on that. It’s a good way to sham an election.
Keep your eyes off the election. The Mayan calendar says we’re going to die.
Oh, man, check me out. I’m sneaking in the White House. Keep your eyes on the
prize. Who are you going to vote for?
Audience member 
Ron Paul.
Brian Fallon 
OK, that’s better.
Audience member 
Ron Paul.
Brian Fallon 
That’s two for Ron Paul.
Audience member 
Obama.
Brian Fallon 
Big Ron Paul in this room. Two for Mike Ness, two for Ron Paul. Obama’s got
one. It’s getting hot. It’s not looking good. Who?
Audience member 
Obama.
Brian Fallon 
Obama, two for Obama. There’s one guy that they told me on Punk News that just
blew up that wants to take away porno.
RBMA 
Rick Santorum.
Brian Fallon 
What’s up with him?
[laughter]
RBMA 
From what I understand he’s telling Fox News what they should be covering at
this point.
Brian Fallon 
Really? You notice I’m not saying anything because I don’t know.
RBMA 
That was another issue on Punk News recently. It was a good point I believe
brought up by Anti Flag. We do have a few questions from the audience.
Brian Fallon 
Anti Flag, those guys are very concerned. You know what’s funny, I think
that’s funny about Anti Flag? Right before you get to the questions, those
guys are some of the funniest dudes ever. Yet they are very serious about
politics. That is a funny group of guys. That’s amazing. When I listened to
their records, I was, “Boring.” Even though it’s so important, it’s just
because I’m not smart enough to follow what they say. They use big words I
don’t understand. I met them and hung out with them. Those are the funniest
dudes in the world. I had a good time with them. I don’t like to talk about
politics. I like to talk about it when it’s funny. OK, hope that guy wins. As
long as you’re not trying to kill anybody, that’s the guy I like. I don’t vote
either way. I just try to go for the guy that’s going to kill the least
people. That’s the safe bet.
RBMA 
Solid?
Brian Fallon 
Yeah, maybe health insurance, too.
RBMA 
Solid as a rock. That’s nice.
Brian Fallon 
People could use that. Canadians got that figured out. Maybe we should vote
for the Canadian guy.
RBMA 
Bring him in.
Brian Fallon 
What do you think, a Canadian president? That’s weird.
RBMA 
That is weird.
Brian Fallon 
Do you have to be born here to be president?
RBMA 
I think you do have to be born here. There was an issue about a birth
certificate. I heard something about that this year.
Brian Fallon 
He was born in Hawaii.
RBMA 
That’s in the U.S.
Brian Fallon 
Surfing, bud, good.
RBMA 
What’s the problem? He’s fine.
Brian Fallon 
Nothing, no problem.
RBMA 
Hell of a body surfer.
Brian Fallon
People give him a lot of flak though. They give Obama a ton of flak. I pay
attention a lot more than I say I do. You would too if you were surrounded by
people in opposing views. If that’s what the deal is, it’s hard. You have two
completely separate viewpoints. One guys trying to do one thing. One guy’s
trying to the other thing. You’re not going to get anything done. It’s like
when two cars ram each other. It’s just doesn’t go anywhere. I don’t know. It
doesn’t matter. We’re not going to get to see the election. Mayan calendar,
it’s going to die. [laughter] When do they say it’s going to happen?
RBMA 
I don’t know.
Brian Fallon
December? 
RBMA 
Right after the election.
Brian Fallon 
I don’t care. I’ll have my motorcycle license by then. I’ll get a few months
riding in, surfing season will be over. Don’t care. December, record will be
out. Who cares?
RBMA 
All right.
Brian Fallon 
Yes?
RBMA 
Do you care to talk to the audience a little bit?
Brian Fallon 
Sure.
RBMA 
Some nice folks here have…
Brian Fallon 
I can’t see them.
RBMA 
…submitted a few questions. We have Alissa from Asbury Park. Where’s Alissa?
Alissa, go ahead and stand up. Do we have a microphone for Alissa?
Brian Fallon 
There’s a lot of chatter on that side of the room, lot of chatter. I just
wanted everybody to hear you. Speak clearly into the microphone. It might be
your last question publically.
Audience member 
Oh, God.
Brian Fallon 
Might die this year, I don’t know.
Audience member 
Probably.
Brian Fallon 
All of us, I mean.
Audience member 
Yeah. Has there been a big difference in the creative process between when you
guys were with an independent label and now on a major?
Brian Fallon 
No, truthfully, which I thought that there was going to be. I thought that
there was going to be a lot of submitting of things and a lot of asking. Can
we do this? Surprisingly, there was none. We got to go and make our record and
finish it without anyone bothering us at all. Matter of fact, they came in at
the end and heard if we would’ve messed it up. [laughs] Whoa, that’d been
bad news. They came in at the end and they trusted us enough to do it. We did
think that. You hear stories. You hear horror stories. But in all the horror
stories with bands, and major labels, you have to look at the band and the
label. You know, every relationship is unique. I didn’t get in this to kick
and scratch and complain. I went and said, “I told you. I want to play Giant
Stadium, want to be on a major label. I did tons of records with indie
labels.” Those guys, Joe and Bill were the best guys in the world. But we gave
them what we were supposed to give them. We agreed to them, “Hey, we’ll give
you this. This amount of records. When that records is done, we’re going to
try something else.” Because why not, man? If I can be the kid that’s on the
cover of Time Magazine, I’ll take it. I’ll buy you a drink while I’m at it.
All right.
[applause]
RBMA 
All right, he’s buying drinks. How about Michael from Montclair? Where’s
Michael?
Brian Fallon 
Did you purposely pick people in the front row?
Audience member 
Hey.
Brian Fallon 
Hey.
Audience member 
Back when you guys used to open, what’s the one band that you opened for that
you learned the most from about the music business? What’s the one band?
Brian Fallon 
Oh, that was probably our first tour. Against Me! took us out and they taught
us a lot about the workings of music. That was our big educational lesson.
That was the first time that we were experiencing managers and booking agents
and music as a business in addition to as an art, which those two things live
in separate rooms. When you’re in one room, you’re not in the other room. With
that tour specifically, we were doing our Señor and the
Queen EP.
Their tour manager, Jordan, was our label guy. They really gave us the biggest
education that a young band could ask for. They really taught us. This is what
everyone’s going to be trying to get you. Remember, no one would be your
friend if you never put on a guitar. Just remember that. I don’t think we’ve
ever forgotten that. That was an incredible lesson on that whole six weeks or
whatever it was. That was the biggest one so far.
Audience member 
Excellent.
Brian Fallon 
I feel like somebody should clap for you. [applause]
RBMA 
All right. Pat from Cranford. Where’s Pat? Also in the front row, perfect.
Audience member 
How you doing, Brian?
Brian Fallon 
Hey, man. Can’t see. Oh, there you are.
Audience member 
Just got a quick question.
Brian Fallon 
Sure.
Audience member 
You toured all over the place, how would you compare touring Europe and the
States, pros and cons? What do you like, what do you don’t like?
Brian Fallon 
Europe, I love the fact that you can go to a festival. No one can know who you
are. They’ll legitimately watch you and make a decision. They’ll get into you
even if they don’t know you at all. Con, food, unh, not so great. It’s not
great because when you travel a lot, your system goes through all kinds of
changes when you move to a different country. You’re eating different food
every day from all different places. You don’t have time to adapt. You just
get this sluggish malaise that happens to you. That’s the down side. With the
States, though, it’s home. That’s just the thing about it. Nowhere else will
ever compare because that’s where you [want to be successful]. I remember, the
Kings of Leon, people tell this story a lot. They were huge overseas, in
England particularly, to the point where they were famous, famous. They were
about not that big here during the time that I’m speaking of. All they wanted
was to be big in America ‘cause that’s where they’re from. That’s a lot of
bands’ cases. You can never really not love playing in your own country. I’m
sure people feel that way all over the world. That’s the main differences.
People really do absorb more music there. They’re more open to it, to new
things. Here it’s just it’s home. I don’t know, I love this place. It’s a good
place.
Audience member 
Thanks, man.
[applause]
Brian Fallon 
Yeah, are you going to ask anybody in the back?
RBMA 
No. That’s all the questions we had.
Brian Fallon 
You had three? All right.
RBMA 
You have answered all the questions about politics, civilization, and music
tonight. We’re all set.
Brian Fallon 
All right.
RBMA 
Is there any chance you’ll play a few songs for us?
Brian Fallon 
Yeah.
RBMA 
All right.
Brian Fallon 
I got to go get my guitar.
RBMA 
All right. Brian’s going to go get his guitar. Ladies and gentlemen, Brian
Fallon. He’s a handful for the Gaslight Anthem. Thank you so much, Brian.
Brian Fallon 
I’ll be back.

From London to Bristol, Scuba has lived in the most pivotal points in the UK’s bass compass. Now he’s taken the time-honoured road to Berlin, where he runs a regular night in Berghain, as well as his Hotflush record label. In his 2011 Red Bull Music Academy lecture, Scuba discusses the influence of jungle and garage, running labels, the decline of dubstep, and more.
Gerd Janson 
The gentleman to the left of me grew up in London, spent some time in Bristol, then moved to the wonderful city of Berlin in Germany, and goes by the name of Scuba, runs Hotflush Recordings, remixed Wu-Tang Clan, Fever Ray and whatever, so please give him a very warm applause. Welcome! (applause)
Scuba 
Hi, how you doing?
Gerd Janson 
Good to have you here. So talk to us a little bit about your musical past before we get into the future.
Scuba 
Wow! Well, as you said, I grew up in London, somewhere that’s actually quite close to one of the organizers here, we just found out. But yeah, I’m from north London, I started doing music at a really young age, my mum kind of
forced me into music classes and stuff, which I didn’t like too much at the time, but it worked out for the best in the end.
Gerd Janson 
Which instrument?
Scuba 
I was on the piano from like, five, then went through trumpet and guitar and wanted to play the drums but was never allowed to have a drum set. So I’m still a deeply frustrated drummer and I can’t do it, still.
Gerd Janson 
Because your parents felt it would be annoying to have a little drummer boy in
the house?
Scuba 
Yeah, I think that’s basically it. So yeah, I was heavily into the whole thing, sort of indoctrinated from an early age and gradually realized that I wanted to do it seriously. I got into the electronic thing through basically taking drugs, like most people, and it kind of went from there. 
Being the mid-’90s, London was quite a cool place to be in terms of going out and clubs
and what was going on musically there. I kind of missed the first proper acid house thing but I was there just there in time to have an idea of what the ’90s club scene was like.
Gerd Janson 
So maybe some of them are not as old as we are. Before we get into the old man
talk, maybe you can shed some light on London during that time.
Scuba 
It’s difficult to look back on it without rose-tinted glasses on, but I remember it being quite an open-minded kind of place. I mean, in the mid-’90s certainly, jungle was happening, which was a whole different thing entirely, but I started going out to techno clubs and house clubs which you could get
into as a 15- or 16-year-old if you could knock up a fake ID or whatever. It
wasn’t strict at all, really. 
I think for any young kid going out for the
first time to those kind of things, it’s just a new kind of playground really, isn’t it? So there was that side of it and then there was the jungle thing, which I kind of got into. I mean, I wasn’t too fussy about music back then in terms of what was coming out of the speakers, it was more of a kind of
“immerse yourself in the whole kind of lifestyle” aspect of it. 
But the jungle thing was kind of different, like I said, it had that whole kind of rave
culture to it and it had an added kind of violence to it as well. Like you had
to avoid getting mugged on the way to clubs, which added excitement to the whole thing. I certainly look back on it as a better period
in London clubbing history than I’ve seen since. Although having said that, I
think in the last few years London has really improved, too.
Gerd Janson 
So was it strange for you, sort of switching those clubs and parties? Going to
a jungle rave one night and then a “sophisticated” house club the other night?
Scuba 
(laughs) I’m not sure about sophisticated. It wasn’t, but then like I said, I wasn’t so
hung up about musical styles in those days. It was more of a lifestyle thing, and immersing yourself in what was going on, and it was still pretty new. I mean acid house was six or seven years old by then but it was still seen as a sort of cutting-edge thing, I think. I certainly remember it as being that anyway. It probably wasn’t.
Gerd Janson 
And when did you have the non-drug-related epiphany that made you want to start being part of it all? Whether that was buying records or…?
Scuba 
I don’t think I had a non-drug epiphany. Well, I started buying records pretty much as soon as I started going out really. I mean, I didn’t start playing but I did just fully sign up to the whole thing, which involves going to record shops and kind of loitering around
and trying not to make any giant faux pas in front of the staff.
Gerd Janson 
Have you ever had one of those?
Scuba 
I think everyone has had a faux pas in front of record store staff…
Gerd Janson 
Which one was yours?
Scuba 
I’ve ruined a few records in record shops.
Gerd Janson 
And then they made you buy the record?
Scuba 
No, no, then I’d stare them out. (laughter) But yeah, I certainly got into buying stuff early on, and I think as soon as you start getting into that thing… I mean, the concept of vinyl, it’s quite an addictive thing, you know? It draws you in and you want to get
involved in it and you want to build up your collection and it becomes a kind of
status thing. So I was totally in on that, and I think initially, that was
totally what gave me the idea of wanting to start a label. 
Like I say, ’95-’96 is when it all started kicking off for me. But I didn’t really start playing out until a couple of years later, by which time I had an enormous collection
of unplayed vinyl, so it was great to be able to do that, finally. But I think
certainly the idea of doing a label was started quite early on.
Gerd Janson 
When did you actively start to spin records?
Scuba 
My first paid gig was in ’98, which is actually a really long time ago now. I was at uni. And actually, Hotflush started as a club night we were doing in uni. I grew up in London, but I went to uni in Bristol and I was there for three years. And yeah, Hotflush was a thing we cooked up, and there was a room of
garage and a room of jungle, and I was playing in the garage room. First gigs are always pretty bad, aren’t they? And mine was no different.
Gerd Janson 
When you say it was the first “paid gig,” was it really paid, or was it just kept money?
Scuba 
Well, the first one was our night, so I guess it wasn’t really paid. But as a result of doing at your own night, people sort of notice what you’re doing and offer token gestures of wanting you to spin records in their clubs. I mean, getting a few quid to play a gig is sort of a seductive thing as well, isn’t
it? Getting paid for doing something that you just do in your bedroom.
Gerd Janson 
And you mentioned garage?
Scuba 
Yeah, I mentioned that I’d done the house and techno thing, and jungle thing, and I had amassed a huge amount of records from all over, really. I’ve got a massive jungle collection from ’95, and early house stuff as well. 
But garage, I guess came around quite quickly, and in London it seemed to be overnight that every single pirate radio station was playing jungle, and literally the next week, every single one was playing garage, and they didn’t stop playing garage until I think, 2001. And then literally, overnight, there was literally no garage anywhere. 
But I think garage is slightly misunderstood outside the UK. I think certainly what has happened over the last couple of years is that it’s done a little bit to rectify itself. But it certainly had a bad reputation. It never
really kicked off, even outside of London really. It was never really that big in
the north of England, it was never really that big even in Bristol, but in London it was just the only music you’d hear, full stop. Well, for a least three or four years.
Gerd Janson 
The term is also a little bit misleading.
Scuba 
Yeah, technically, you should say “UK” at the start of it.
Gerd Janson 
Not “Paradise”.
Scuba 
Right. But having said that, the way it started in London was very much from the US stuff. What it was originally was, at the jungle raves, the second room would be garage. It would be UK DJs, but playing the US stuff, and this was from really early on, this was like, ’93-’94.
Gerd Janson 
Like Armand van Helden, Todd Edwards...
Scuba 
Yeah, and New York Strictly Rhythm-type stuff. But the difference with what the UK guys were doing is that they would pitch it up
really fast, which is where the term speed garage came from. I think a lot of
it was guys who were disillusioned as jungle was changing from quite an interesting kind of music to a fairly noisy racket. So I think that turned quite a lot of people off, and a lot of them went onto garage. And gradually
it becomes this kind of all-encompassing thing. It had a commercial element
that jungle never had, and I think that’s ultimately what did for it – people
started chasing the money too much, but that kind of happened a little bit
later on.
Gerd Janson 
When you say “commercial edge” do you mean that it was actually more song-based?
Scuba 
Yeah, I mean for some reason when you tend to have vocals on something, that
seems to make it more commercial and I’ve never really quite understood why that it is.
Gerd Janson 
People like to sing along.
Scuba 
Yeah, I guess. It certainly had that in a way that jungle never did. That combined with the fact that it became a really big underground thing – it had that commercial element more than jungle ever had, to the detriment of the scene, I think.
Gerd Janson 
And that was part of the menu at your first night at Hotflush?
Scuba 
That was the room that I was playing in and it was the kind of music that I
had become interested in by then. This was ’98. But having said that, like I was just
saying about that commercial side of it, that began to turn me off just as soon
as I got into it. There was always interesting sides to garage, even by 2001
when mainstream garage had become terrible, unlistenable. 
There was always interesting stuff going on and my trajectory as a DJ was starting with a
garage bass but trying to introduce other aspects to it as well, like house
and the broken beat stuff that was going on in the late ’90s, like Bugz in the Attic and all that kind of stuff, and
breaks, and just trying to construct a slightly different take on the garage
scene. 
That was how the label came about, it was an attempt to recreate a home for these kinds of different influences – and actually it didn’t work at all. It just became a dubstep label, but that’s another story.
Gerd Janson 
But before we come to that, why Hotflush as a name? How did that come about?
Scuba 
Someone’s girlfriend thought of it and we’ve been stuck with it ever since.
Gerd Janson 
No deeper meaning?
Scuba 
No.
Gerd Janson 
Do you find that this is often the best way, to find a word for something, and
the meaning comes later?
Scuba 
Well, a lot of people assume that is an homage to the Red Snapper track, which I’m kind of
OK with. I’d rather people think that than knowing that it was just someone’s
girlfriend’s brainstorm. I’ve never tried to lie about it.
Gerd Janson 
It was in Bristol, right? How much was the city an influence on what you did?
Scuba 
Not really. What we tried to do with the club night was do the London thing in
Bristol and that’s what we’ve done with the nights in Berlin since moving
there. I haven’t really tried to do a Berlin thing, I’ve just tried to do a
London thing in Berlin. 
Having said that, especially back then, Roni Size had just won the Mercury Music Prize and there was such a hype about Bristol back in those days – I mean, there still is to some extent, but back then, it was the thing. But we didn’t try and engage with it too deeply,
it was like, “We’re from London,” in a typically arrogant London way.
Gerd Janson 
Sometimes. That’s how Londoners are. How did you go about starting the label? Did you know anything about the music business?
Scuba 
No, absolutely nothing. I moved back to London in 2001 when I finished studying and I almost immediately wanted to get something started. But yeah, I had absolutely no clue whatsoever, nothing. And it was a very slow, torturous, expensive process, basically. What was good about that was that we didn’t have any
preconceptions about anything – we just wanted to find good music and then find a way to release it. Actually, I think that’s quite a healthy attitude to have, when you’re running a label – one which a lot of labels lose sight of when they get deeper into that whole industry side of it. Having said that it
took two years to get a record out. That’s the flipside of not knowing what the hell is going on.
Gerd Janson 
Why did it take two years? Getting a demo?
Scuba 
No, we were getting tons of new music. The whole thing revolved around and was intertwined with how dubstep developed, and was kind of how it became a dubstep label by accident. There was this club called
FWD, which is still going in London, which
started the week that I came back from Bristol. It was the first one and we turned up there. It was supposedly a breakbeat garage night at that time – the kind of trendy thing was breakbeat garage, which is like
Zinc’s stuff.
Gerd Janson 
What is the difference between breakbeat garage and UK garage?
Scuba 
Semantics, I guess. No, it’s cut-up breaks, and no swing and less vocals. It
was basically an attempt to drive away the women, I think. But at that time
that was what the cool thing was. And so that’s what FWD was originally,
that’s what it was talked up as anyway, as this cool breakbeat garage night. But there
were a lot of different things going on at the edge of garage at the same time
and a lot of the same people got drawn into FWD.
Hatcha was one of the first residents
there, and Zed Bias, and J Da Flex and
a few names that are still around now. But the punters were making tracks, so
what it quickly became was that you would go there once a month with a bag of
CDs of the tracks that you’d been making and you’d give them to your mates
that you saw once a month at FWD. 
So people like Digital Mystikz, like Caspa, and plenty of other people who
subsequently went on to be quite successful were just kids, swapping tracks.
So from very early on we had a lot of music that we wanted to put out, but no
way of doing it. So we pressed up some records and tried to distribute it ourselves, and failed miserably. That was probably my worst experiences in record shops, was going in with your record just to be told, “No, this isn’t going to sell, get out.” That wasn’t much fun. And that actually went on up until about the third release. Yeah, I’ve got plenty of bad experiences in record shops, now I
remember it – I’d forgotten about them.
Gerd Janson 
There must have been a shop that liked your music.
Scuba 
There was one or two, yeah. Basically, the other thing that happened around
that time was that Rinse FM took on a bunch of new DJs.
Gerd Janson 
Rinse FM? Can you explain for people that might not know about that?
Scuba 
Rinse FM was at that time one of the bigger pirate stations in London. They had basically broken grime, they had Dizzee Rascal way before he got signed, and they had Wiley and everyone else, it was a grime station. Then they decided to broaden the appeal
and get some “cutting edge” new stuff and so I was amongst the bunch of new DJs they got, and one of the things that Rinse FM had was a distribution arm. 
So the first distribution that we had was the one that was run by Rinse, which was basically just a guy in a white van who drove around doing the DIY distribution thing, instead of you having to do it, which I was quite happy
with.
Gerd Janson 
So then he had to take all the beef from shops?
Scuba 
Yeah! I was very glad to be out of the side of it anyway. But luckily for us, we actually got a proper distribution deal by release three, which is obviously the most important thing for any label, past the A&R side is the
distribution side. So by that time we were happy to be vaguely on our way. That was in 2004 that we got our distribution deal, and we didn’t start selling records until 2008, so it was a long road. There was a lot of waiting around and waiting for stuff to happen.
Gerd Janson 
Before we actually listen to some of the stuff that happened on your label, do
you have any tips on how to deal with the distribution deal?
Scuba 
Well, apart from that Rinse one, I’ve only ever had one deal, which was with
ST Holdings. So I’m very happy to say
that, fingers crossed, it is a very well-run company at the moment.
Gerd Janson 
But there are different distribution deals you can get as a label...
Scuba 
There are. There’s just a straight distribution where you have to front the
money for pressing the records yourself and you deal with shipping and you give it to a distributor and they pay you per unit. Or there’s the so-called P&D, which is where they take care of the manufacturing side for you, which obviously takes a lot of the work out of it. And they obviously have better
deals than you can possibly get with the pressing plant, so there’s a double
benefit to it. So that’s actually what we had, from 2004.
Gerd Janson 
Do you have an early example of what early Hotflush sounded like?
Scuba 
Yeah, we’ve got the third release, which is probably a good place to start.
This is a track by Search & Destroy who was one of the guys I mentioned, one of the early punters and CD-swappers. The track’s
called “Candyfloss.”
(music: Search & Destroy – “Candyfloss”)
Gerd Janson 
So this one has all the ingredients that qualify as dubstep?
Scuba 
I don’t think so, no. To be honest, that tune is definitely from the period when dubstep and garage were still
almost part of the same thing. I would probably call it dubstep, but I don’t
know if that many other people would. I’m not sure.
Gerd Janson 
It’s always hard, being a non-Londoner, to catch up with all those genres and
the speed of it?
Scuba 
Yeah, and actually one of the more contentious parts of the early dubstep thing was splitting it down into the early subgenres, and in various cases it got quite acrimonious. There was definitely a kind of movement against the
more breakbeat aspect of the sound, which got a little bit heated at some stages. There were various journalists who shall remain nameless, who probably weighed in more than they should have done. Generally speaking, the early
dubstep scene was remarkably friendly and remarkably united. Within the context of that, there was a little bit of cliqueyness that went on, and the cliqueyness did tend to revolve around those subgenres that were
picked up. 
But the whole thing was so ridiculously small, though, it seems absurd even talking about it like that. I mean, FWD was a tiny club, it was only once a month and you’d be lucky to see 100 people down there. It does seem a bit silly thinking about it like that, but you know, in the context in what it became, maybe it is worth it, but maybe not.
Gerd Janson 
What did it become, in your opinion?
Scuba 
A really terrible music scene. To be honest. (laughs)
Gerd Janson 
Terrible in what way?
Scuba 
Terrible music! I mean, dubstep is awful now. It is absolutely terrible.
There’s no point lying about it. I’ve spent the last three years trying to
disassociate myself from it. But you know, that’s what happens sometimes.
There’s so many examples of it happening in the past – the guys that were
involved with the jungle scene early on I’m sure would have said exactly the same
things about stuff happening in 1998. 
Like what I was saying about the exit
into garage, it’s part of the same thing. Exactly the same thing
happened in the dubstep scene. Everyone just got out because it just got too
shit, frankly.
Gerd Janson 
Why does something get too shit? Because from the 100 people who were at
FWD it is now all of a sudden 1,000 and more and more?
Scuba 
I think it’s basically a race to the lowest common denominator, which is
usually what is the most popular. That’s a slightly cynical way of
looking at it but I think certainly in the context of London-based, bass-orientated
music that seems to have been the trend of the last 20 years, it starts off good and
ends up shit.
Gerd Janson 
Or the “hardcore continuum” like some journalists like to call it?
Scuba 
Yeah, I was trying to avoid using that.
Gerd Janson 
We obviously, because it is terrible music, don’t want to hear any dubstep
from now, but maybe you have something to show how Hotflush sounds.
Scuba 
Well, I think it would be useful to go into that breaks angle a little bit because Hotflush got associated with this breaks/dubstep scene – “breakstep” was what it was ridiculously called. And like I say, it was the source of a fair bit of disagreement. But actually, some of the music was great, and this track from Hotflush #7 is one of my favorite releases on the label. It’s
called “The Lights” and it’s by Eric H], who is a producer from Chicago
actually. I think this is his only ever release, as well.
(music: Eric H – “The Lights” / applause)
Gerd Janson 
So how does a guy from Chicago end up on a label from London?
Scuba 
Well, the key difference in early dubstep to early jungle was that there was
the internet.
Gerd Janson 
So was it via a MySpace message?
Scuba 
Well, I don’t remember, but yeah, it might have been. I think that is the key
difference in how the music was able to spread internationally – it was pirate
radio sets being posted online and being available to anyone. And in the early
days that was obviously incredibly significant in how people learned about the
early sound and interacted themselves; that was a result of that.
Gerd Janson 
What does a demo file have to have to get your attention?
Scuba 
That’s a really good question. It’s almost impossible to answer, to be honest,
because there isn’t a tangible thing that makes a track releasable. It doesn’t
have to be particularly well produced, it doesn’t have to be perfect in any
way, it’s just an idea that is realized to a good extent. It’s a really impossible question, almost. 
For example, the first stuff that Mount Kimbie sent me was pretty much two minutes of silence and then one snare drum in the middle and then another two minutes of silence. So you know, I didn’t listen to that and
think, “Yeah, let’s put that out, definitely!” But it was sufficiently interesting to make me want to pursue it.
Gerd Janson 
You could have gotten a few remixes...
Scuba 
(laughs) Yeah, maybe.
Gerd Janson 
Mount Kimbie might be a good example because they’re not really dubstep, are
they?
Scuba 
Well, as I’ve been trying to say, we’re not really a dubstep label. I think, as I said before, the original aim for the label was for it to be really quite a wide-ranging thing and the only reason it become a dubstep label in the early days is because the producers we were meeting up with had this night
every month. That was really the only reason why we got sucked into that whole
thing. 
It’s only really been in the last four years – coincidentally since I left London, but I don’t think that was a massively significant thing in the history of the label – but it’s only really been since then, for whatever reason, that we’ve been able to branch out and do different things. By the time Mount Kimbie came around, which was in about 2009, whether it was dubstep or not was totally irrelevant. Nowadays, the less dubstep it is, the more
likely I am to give it more than 10 seconds of my time.
Gerd Janson 
How do you decide which demo you give 10 seconds of your time to? Do you
listen to everything you get sent?
Scuba 
Someone does, yeah. I listen to most of it. There’s two people that work on
the label with me and everything gets listened to at least once.
Gerd Janson 
So you have filters installed?
Scuba 
Not very good ones, but yeah. I wish I could get some better ones.
Gerd Janson 
And you have the last say?
Scuba 
Yeah, it’s my decision.
Gerd Janson 
Any regrets so far?
Scuba 
Good try! No, when I look back on the catalog there are obviously different
phases to it, musical stages that it’s gone through, but generally speaking I
think we’ve been pretty consistent as a label. I think the quality of what
we’ve put out is good; I don’t think there are many other labels that have
done what we’ve done in the last six years or so. When I look back on it, I
think it’s pretty solid.
Gerd Janson 
Shall we listen to something by Mount Kimbie?
Scuba 
OK. Like I said, their first demo was slightly avant-garde, but I think the
second or third track they sent me was a track called “Maybes” and that was
kind of ready for release as soon as I heard it. This is it.
(music: Mount Kimbie – “Maybes”)
Gerd Janson 
Could you please talk a little bit about Mount Kimbie? Because their music kind of left
the – and this is the last time I’m going to use the word “dubstep” – scene and became something bigger.
Scuba 
I guess they’re a band, I suppose. From very early on they wanted to do the
whole live thing, and do it properly, as opposed to standing in front of a
laptop and pretending to do it live, and musically they’ve always been really
willing to experiment and willing to try new things and not worry too much
about what people are going to think about it, which is great from an A&R
perspective and is something I always try and encourage people to do. We get a
lot of demos, which are great but are too slavishly following whatever they
perceive to be trendy at any given moment. 
Mount Kimbie are the complete
opposite of that, they don’t care, they do whatever.  With the album, I
didn’t A&R it at all, they just gave me an album and I put it out, which is great and probably good from their perspective. One of the reasons I’ve never wanted to
release on a different label is because I don’t think I’d be able to deal with
being told what to do musically, and I try to not do that as much as possible
with people on Hotflush.
Gerd Janson 
So you don’t try to coach them?
Scuba 
No, there have been instances in the past where I’ve tried to do that and it
never works out.
Gerd Janson 
Does it make it worse?
Scuba 
Yeah, I think so. Maybe it’s because I’m not such a great teacher, but I think people have to work it out for themselves. It’s something that should be worked out in the studio on your own rather than someone telling you, “Put
this hi-hat there.” 
Gerd Janson 
There is this quote by Jeff Mills,
who is a techno DJ from Detroit for those who might not have heard of him, and
he said, “If you want to send me some music, do 100 tracks and then send me
the 101st you do.”
Scuba 
Right OK, I’m not completely sure I get what he means by that. 
Gerd Janson 
Practice.
Scuba 
But yeah, I think if there’s something there you can usually tell pretty early on. But not always, people take different amounts of time to develop – I think it took me a long
time to develop as a producer. There’s no set formula to any of it.
Gerd Janson 
Before we speak about you as a producer, with Mount Kimbie did you have many
offers from “major labels” to take them?
Scuba 
Yeah, I can’t really talk about specifics, but their second album isn’t going to be on Hotflush, put it that way. Without actually making vocal tracks, they do have a certain amount of commercial potential. I hope they don’t go down the full vocal-track route, which a lot of people seem to do when they
sign to majors, with usually pretty terrible results. So I hope they don’t do that.
Gerd Janson 
So maybe they should attend some songwriting and arrangement classes?
Scuba 
Maybe. Maybe they should be here.
Gerd Janson 
And how hard it is for you as a label owner to see people go? Or are you more of a promiscuous kind of guy? Some label owners try to have a certain artist repertoire and always work with them and other people are OK with...
Scuba 
Well, it’s gone in stages. With the history of the label there have been different people who have been associated with it at different times. On Friday night we had the launch for the Sepalcure album, which is an album that
is coming out… actually it was released today, in fact. They’re two guys from New
York and we had George Fitzgerald playing and
Sigha playing and Kai from Mount Kimbie was there and there’s a good bunch of guys associated with the label at the moment, and
it’s a lot of fun to be around them. But saying that, if people want to go and
do different things or go and start their own label or whatever, it’s fine.
I’m on good terms with anyone who’s released on the label in the past.
Gerd Janson 
They kind of have to keep in tune with what you like as well, right?
Scuba 
Yeah, if I don’t like it then it’s not coming out, unfortunately. It’s tough.
Gerd Janson 
Let’s talk a little bit about yourself as a producer. Who does the quality control for you?
Scuba 
Well, it’s me. I think I do beat myself up about it pretty hard. I just
finished a new album and about a month before I finished it I came to the
realization that everything I’d done was pretty crap, and I had to pretty much
do it all again. And actually that’s happened with both previous albums I’ve
released as well. I tend to succumb to bouts of extreme self-doubt and
paranoia about my work.
Gerd Janson 
Do you show it to other people or is it just your own judgment?
Scuba 
No, I play it to people when its finished. I don’t tend to play people
unfinished tracks really. Again, I think it’s just a process that I think I
have to go through in the studio, and it doesn’t really help playing it to
other people. It’s just a sort of self-flagellation thing that has to happen.
Gerd Janson 
I mean, if you say it’s crap, that’s just your own judgment.
Scuba 
Right. I mean, if you’re not happy with what you’re doing, then what’s the
point? For me, making music is a personal thing; if I’m not happy with it then
it completely defeats the purpose of the whole exercise.
Gerd Janson 
Do you have something we should listen to?
Scuba 
Yeah. The first track that I made that I was really 100% happy with was
off the first album, and it’s called “Hard Boiled” and I’m going to have to
fast-forward the intro because it’s really long.
(music: Scuba – “Hard Boiled” / applause)
Gerd Janson 
You mentioned Berlin earlier on. So was this track produced in London or in Berlin?
Scuba 
It’s one of the first tracks I made after I moved over actually and it sounds
like it, but I don’t really think it was as significant as it maybe sounds
like.
Gerd Janson 
Why did you make the move?
Scuba 
A combination of different things. Like I was saying, I had grown up in London and I had lived there the whole time apart from the three years in Bristol and I just decided to do something else. Obviously, I wanted to do it in some other place where I could be in a creative environment. Berlin is almost kind of clichéd in its creativity, or supposed creativity, but it seemed like the obvious thing to do. I’ve really enjoyed living there, I don’t have any intention of moving
back to London. It’s a good place to be based.
Gerd Janson 
The weather is roughly the same.
Scuba 
Well, it doesn’t get down to -30 in London! It’s completely different to London in the sense that it’s a city of 4 million people but it feels more like Bristol than it feels like London, and maybe that’s because despite the image of it, the creative community is actually pretty small.
Gerd Janson 
But the party community...
Scuba 
Well, the party community is pretty big, that’s true. The clubs are really what makes it, I suppose. It’s similar to what I was saying about London in the mid-’90s. It’s sort of more similar to there than anywhere else in the world. Which is nice to have on your doorstep, but can also be a bit dangerous. But like I said, I like living there, it’s great.
Gerd Janson 
How much did it influence you and your music? Because you said when you were
in Bristol, that it had no influence on what you were doing musically.
Scuba 
Well, I’ve always been into house and techno, so it’s not like suddenly I woke up one day in Berlin and realized there was this amazing new music called house and techno. I don’t think there’s been as much of a direct influence as
maybe some people seem to think, but having said that, you can’t help but be slightly influenced by your surroundings. 
When I moved over in 2007, minimal was still quite a big thing. Everywhere was playing minimal, so if all you hear is minimal, it’s going to rub off to a certain extent. But that could make you make minimal or make you hate it completely.
Gerd Janson 
So when you say minimal, you don’t mean Daniel Bell, right? You mean the kick drum
and the white noise?
Scuba 
Yeah, the less said about that the better, probably. But yeah, it died off
pretty quickly after I moved over, it was pretty done. So it’s just been house
mainly, in Berlin. Regular mainstream house seems to be the thing that gets
played most regularly.
Gerd Janson 
You have to talk a little bit about a certain club in Berlin that you’re kind
of involved in on a regular basis.
Scuba 
Yes, the Berghain thing is a privilege to be involved with it. One of the first things I wanted to get going when I moved over was a night, and back then dubstep was still vaguely okay and it hadn’t really taken off so much in
Berlin, and so the intention was to do not a mainstream dubstep night, but a slightly leftfield dubstep night. The obvious place to do it was Berghain, but they never had an outside promoter at all before we started doing our night there. So we figured that there was no way that they would even have a meeting with us.
Gerd Janson 
Maybe you can describe Berghain a little bit for those who haven’t been there
or don’t know about the club.
Scuba 
OK, for people who don’t know, it actually started off as a gay fetish club called Snax, I think, and it is predominantly mostly a gay thing. But it’s in a massive old warehouse in the middle of Berlin. It’s an incredible venue, it has massive high ceilings and post-industrial kind of décor, and it’s got amazing sound and an amazing atmosphere and it’s run by a bunch of guys who
only really care about music, it seems. I’m sure they do make money, but
everything about it is focused on making the experience for clubbers as good as possible. So it’s run in exactly the right way that a club should be run and in a way that I can’t compare to any other club in the world.
Gerd Janson 
Not of that size certainly.
Scuba 
Definitely not, no. So like I say, we were looking for a venue to do this night in Berlin and the guy who I run it with bumped into one of the guys that works there and he said, “Can we come in for a meeting?” So we came in for a
meeting and expected at best to be offered a Thursday or a Sunday or some kind
of backwater kind of time, and the first thing they said to us was, “Do you wanna do Friday night?” 
So we were desperately trying not to lose our poker faces and we did our first one in July in 2008, and we’ve been doing it every
three months and it’s just been a really great thing to be a part of, really. It’s just a proper environment and, like I say, run by a bunch of guys who really take the whole thing incredibly seriously. It’s been great.
Gerd Janson 
Berlin seems to like that kind of thing anyway, with Hardwax being a record
shop...
Scuba 
Well, I think that’s there’s certainly an element there. I mean, dub-techno is
a very Berlin thing, and the crossover with leftfield dubstep, which I guess was kind of started by Skull Disco and Villalabos’s involvement with Skull Disco was in 2007, and that whole thing brought the dub-techno
Berlin thing and left-field dubstep thing much closer together. 
So yeah, there’s definitely a kind of contingent in Berlin that is conducive to that whole thing, but I think it probably gets written about more than it actually
exists in a tangible way. There’s a lot of people who are into it, but there’s
not a lot of events. There’s not a lot of clubs going on doing that kind of
sound at all, really, outside Berghain. But there is also an audience for it as
well, to a certain extent – I mean certainly for us, to be able to do Friday
nights and regularly get 1,000 people in, in a place where it’s basically just
house most of the time. So yeah, there’s certainly an appetite for it to a
certain extent.
Gerd Janson 
So there is no mutual antipathy? Which was the name of your first album.
Scuba 
Yeah, it is, it’s good you got that in there. Impressive.
Gerd Janson 
Why [A] Mutual Antipathy?
Scuba 
I don’t think I’ve ever talked about the title of that album, ever. It was a reference to me in the dubstep scene, actually, which is what that album refers to. I didn’t like it and I didn’t think it liked me very much, which
sounds quite a bit emo, really.
Gerd Janson 
Sometimes you have to know when it’s time to go, right?
Scuba 
Yeah, exactly. The majority of that album was written in the three months after I moved over, so it kind of summed up what was going on with me at that time. The differences between the two cities and the two club scenes and attitudes towards music, and actually the attitudes toward clubbing, which I would completely sum up in the way that Berghain is run versus the way that big clubs in London are run – which is the complete opposite of what I’ve just been saying of how Berghain is taken care of. 
It’s difficult not to look at London, when you compare the two of them, in a really bad light, and I don’t want to sit here slagging off London. But as a place for me to be, Berlin is definitely the one.
Gerd Janson 
They are also on a different time schedule, right?
Scuba 
Yeah, no one goes out until three in the morning in Berlin.
Gerd Janson 
Does that influence the way you DJ there compared to London?
Scuba 
Yeah, in terms of the way you run a night, anyway, it’s different. Just having the concept of curfews doesn’t exist in Berlin, which immediately takes away a whole constraining element out of the club scene, entirely. That’s what holds a lot of places back, certainly in the UK. Or in places like Ireland, where everything shuts at about 2:30 or 3 – it’s just a completely different experience entirely. Generally speaking with clubs, the more freedom you have the better, and if you don’t have to close, then that’s quite a lot of freedom.
Gerd Janson 
So how do you program your Sub:Stance nights there then?
Scuba 
Well, we start at 12 and we aim to run until about 9 AM or 10 AM. What I like
playing the most is the last set, which tends to start at about 6 or 6:30 and you can go on until as long as you like, or until the night manager wants
to go home, which tends to be about 10 AM or 11 AM, maybe. You just have a lot
of freedom. The difference between a Sub:Stance and a regular Panorama bar
nights is that they tend to have long sets – so it’s usually a four-hour set minimum, and we tend to have them shorter. An hour and a half tends to be the shortest ones we have, which took a lot of getting used to for the Berghain guys, because their whole thing is that DJing is a musical journey. As cliché as that is, there’s definitely an element of truth in it. It’s really nice to have longer sets. But a lot of DJs from the UK aren’t used to that, they’re used to maybe playing one hour. 
Gerd Janson 
The other cliché is to tell a story.
Scuba 
Right, exactly. Exactly. So it’s a different way of programming a night, to the four-hour marathon. The last sets they have at Berghain go on for minimum eight hours, I think, which is excessive for me. I don’t know if I could
deal with that. We tend to have five or six acts and the first few hours will be five of them and then the last sets are a bit longer.
Gerd Janson 
And does it also influence the way you run Hotflush now, with people in Berlin also being involved in it?
Scuba 
When you live somewhere and you become involved in the scene a little bit, obviously you meet people and you become creatively involved with them. But having said that, I don’t really think I’m really a big part of the Berlin scene at all, really. Past running the Sub:Stance thing at Berghain, I don’t go out a hell of a lot socializing. I know a few DJs but I’m not a kind of a mover and shaker on the circuit. I don’t think it’s had a huge influence on the label or myself that much, really.
Gerd Janson 
And can you play us something from the recent musical output?
Scuba 
I mentioned before the Sepalcure album that comes out today, and I think we’ll play a track of that, because they’ve been
quite important over the last couple of years for the label. Their kind of sound is, if you had to sum up the Hotflush thing, then Sepalcure would be it. They’ve got the combination of textures, melodies and rhythm that has really been integral to the label since thestart. If this is the right one, it should be called “Eternally Yrs.” Yes, this is it.
(music: Sepalcure – “Eternally Yrs”)
Gerd Janson 
You said early on that you don’t have any regrets. But knowing what you know
now, would you start a label again?
Scuba 
Yeah, I think for anyone producing, starting a label has got to be a good idea. Controlling your own copyright is pretty important, I think. That obviously undermines the case for people signing to my label.
Gerd Janson 
Yes, I was about to say, because it’s not like a Scuba label, right?
Scuba 
Right, but if I was giving advice to someone, I would say that it’s something
that as a producer, and as a DJ as well, it can just be helpful to the whole
thing. If you are thinking along the lines of releasing music, it forces you
to focus, and just on a base level, it’s helpful. Also, like I said, in terms
of controlling your own art, I think it’s an incredibly rewarding thing to be
involved with, definitely.
Gerd Janson 
And what does it take for another label to control your art? Because you also
release on other labels, right?
Scuba 
Lots of money. (laughter) Generally speaking, I haven’t released much at all. I released a single on Aus Music this year, it really was an accident. I said that I would do a track for a compilation, and he liked it enough to put it out as a single, and
that was it, really. I’ve only done two or three 12s away from Hotflush.
Gerd Janson 
You keep it tight. 
Scuba 
Yeah.
Gerd Janson 
Maybe we should open it up for some questions now.
Audience Member
Hello. You’ve got a few aliases; do you sit down and think, “I’m going to make
a Scuba track today,” or an SCB
track or a Spectr track? Or do you see
how it progresses?
Scuba 
It’s often very late in the day, well after the track is finished, that it gets assigned a home. Obviously, the SCB stuff has tended to be more straight, more 4/4. A lot of people thought that the “Adrenaline” tune should have
been an SCB tune, but it wasn’t and I can’t really explain why it wasn’t. But it just wasn’t. It’s not something that I think massively deep about; there are obviously slight differences, but it’s not something I try and get too bogged down in.
Gerd Janson 
Is it important then, to have monikers, as an artist?
Scuba 
I don’t know if it’s important. I think it’s important to have an identity, I think that’s crucial, and a lot of the time having a lot of different pseudonyms can dilute that. So actually it can be counterproductive. But, that said, it’s also sometimes just a bit of fun to start something new and see where it goes. There’s a balance to be drawn with that, I think.
Gerd Janson 
So Berlin made you start SCB?
Scuba 
No, Berlin didn’t. We’ve already been through this! (laughter)
Gerd Janson 
Any more?
Audience Member
Hello, I just wanted to say that I enjoy your label a lot. I’m running a label, too. It’s very young. It’s only into its fourth release, and it’s out of Sweden, so I don’t really have a scene that we’re coming from, it isn’t very strong. I was wondering about what you think of promos and all the charting going on nowadays, and how you relate to it.
Scuba 
Do you mean the use of PR?
Audience Member
Yeah, and how it works today, if you think it’s important for your label and
how you handle it.
Scuba 
I think as a label manager you have to do whatever it takes to get your music
out there. If that involves paying a PR company to do it, then I think you have to do it. The sad reality is that a lot of music journalists rely on PR. Like, almost exclusively. So I think if you’re not engaged in that process, then you’re locking yourself out of that system, basically. That is obviously a regrettable development. It’s always been like that to a certain extent. I don’t think you can necessarily say that in the last few years, suddenly that has happened. 
I think in terms of what draws people into writing about music is not always for the best reasons, which doesn’t always lead to
rigorous journalistic standards. There are certain things that you have to do, and they seem like bullshit things, but I think that you have to engage with it, otherwise it’s very difficult to put your stuff out there. I don’t like it at all, but if you look upon it like your responsibility is to the artist whose music you are putting out, and if someone was putting out your records, what
would you expect them to do? You’d expect them to do everything they can to sell it, basically. At a base level that’s what it comes down to, so you have to do.
Audience Member
Hi, I also run a label and make my own music as well. I guess I’m just curious how you find a balance between the creative process of making music and the label management. Because I know some days there are times, weeks
even, when it’s just music, but there’s always that other side as well.
Scuba 
I’m pretty disorganized. There’s a table in my house, which is just a mass of papers. Generally speaking, it’s a juggling thing for me, between producing, label and also DJing, which is taking up more and more of my time. So what tends to happen is that I go in a cycle. So at any one time, at least one
thing is getting badly neglected. Obviously, the best thing to neglect is the admin side of the label, so that tends to be the thing that gets neglected. I mean, you just have to try and do it the best you can, there’s no formula to it.
Audience Member
Are interns the answer?
Scuba 
The problem with interns is that you can’t give them actually anything meaningful to do, because you don’t trust them to do it. So yes and no. Obviously, there are certain things they can help with, but it’s not the
important stuff you’ve gotta do. It’s tough, man.
Gerd Janson 
Do labels make enough money these days to get someone to do the admin for you?
Scuba 
Yeah, I think you can do that; it’s still possible to sell music, just about. The end of the music industry hasn’t happened completely yet. It’s still just about possible to make enough cash to pay the bills and stuff. Just about.
Audience Member
From your sets and latest productions, I get some old-school trance influences. What has drawn you to this music? Because for plenty of people, it’s hard to accept this fact. What has drawn you into trance and what do you
like about it?
Scuba 
Well, actually it might surprise you to learn that I was quite into trance in
the mid-’90s. I went to quite a lot of trance clubs. But this was before it
became rubbish.
Gerd Janson 
Before it became…?
Scuba 
Yeah. That might also be a controversial statement. Trance wasn’t always
rubbish, guys, it really wasn’t. One upon a time, there was some good stuff. Coming out of Germany, actually. Oliver Lieb made some really good stuff. So I don’t accept the notion that trance is inherently bad. But having said that, when I made those tunes I didn’t even see trance as a major touching
point. That wasn’t really in my mind. Obviously I was aware that there was an
old-school thing going on, but I thought it was just an old-school house and
’90s vibe, I didn’t see it as a trance thing. But obviously other people do.
Audience Member
There’s a whole movement of acid techno and old-school trance coming back.
Where do you think it comes from?
Scuba 
That’s a good question, I think people just look for disparate influences and where
there’s been interesting things made in the past, there is potential for it to
be developed further. You could say the same thing about the garage thing, you
know. Garage was dead for at least five years and then suddenly everyone was
playing garage again. People are subconsciously influenced by things they have
previously listened to anyway and these things have a habit of snowballing.
Audience Member
So you think in club music there is very little place to develop something new
and fresh, without taking things from the past?
Scuba 
I think it doesn’t happen too often. I think the really interesting thing about dubstep when it was starting was the fact that it was quite genuinely new. It was something that didn’t have too much precedent. Obviously it had influences, but you couldn’t say it was an updated version of something else. 
Similar to jungle, when jungle started, obviously jungle had influences, but there was nothing that you could have pointed out – there were 95 pitched snare rolls happening, for example. So it’s definitely rare, but I
think taking influences from older stuff should not necessarily be seen as a
negative thing. You can learn stuff from things that have gone past and you
can make something new out of it.
Audience Member
Hello. I was just curious about what you think. A lot of these smaller labels,
that are artist-run, do you think there are walls to the labels? Because a lot
of them start with a good idea in a bedroom but then the heads are so creative
they are afraid to relinquish control. Is there a limited growth to your label
because you can’t bring 20 people and trust them? 
If you look at Warner Bros, where there are like, 500 people, there’s a structure. But with all the small labels, it’s one dude, he loves the graphic design, he loves the artist direction, who gets the remix. There’s so much control that if you don’t relinquish, can you take the next step? Would you like it to go farther or do you like it small?
Scuba 
I think it’s completely down to the individual label. I think there’s
definitely a precedent for it happening. If you look at Warp, for example, that came out of a bedroom-run company and turned into quite a big thing. So I think maybe having a label manager actually being an artist on the label is more of an impediment, just from a pure time-constraint point of view. If you look at Planet Mu, for example, Mike Paradinas hasn’t been active as an artist for a long time, and it’s
probably no coincidence that they’ve been releasing a hell of a lot of stuff
since he stopped making music so actively. 
But I think it shouldn’t necessarily be an obstacle. It’s just up to the individual in question. It’s true for any start-up business that delegating is incredibly hard – when you
have personal ownership over something and you care about it deeply, it’s really difficult to give that to someone else to get on with, you know? Especially an intern. It’s easy to work yourself into the ground, just because you love it so much and you want it to be successful. Again, like most things it’s a balance – you’ve just got to try and make it happen without killing yourself doing it.
Gerd Janson 
When did you know it was the right time to quit your day job?
Scuba 
It felt like the right time every day that I was working, to be honest.
Gerd Janson 
I meant in a way that you could afford to.
Scuba 
Well, you know, you do the sums every month, and if you can get by, and you
don’t have to go in and get told what to do by someone...
Gerd Janson 
But you also have to think about the future.
Scuba 
Yeah, but not too much. If you want to be a DJ, it’s not really a future
thing. No one’s got a pension, have they?
Gerd Janson 
You’re going to have to keep working?
Scuba 
Yeah, exactly. Let’s not think about that too much, shall we? (laughter)
Gerd Janson 
Sorry for that. Health insurance?
Scuba 
I’m still a British citizen. I’m still a British taxpayer. We still have the
NHS, I’m fine. 
Gerd Janson 
God save the Queen.
Scuba 
Right. Exactly.
Gerd Janson 
Thank you very much.
(applause)

Henrik Schwarz is a long time veteran of the German deep house scene, having cut his teeth as a DJ in the ’90s, but it’s been his forays into production that have really set dancefloors alight; his extended, epic approach bringing a jazzy ambience to the 4/4 groove. In addition to running his Sunday Music label, he’s remixed everyone from The Sunburst Band to DJ Hell and Kuniyuki, and recently rolled with Dixon and Âme as part of the Innervisions Orchestra, and collaborating on their mix CD The Grandfather Paradox. 
On the couch with him for this 2010 Red Bull Music Academy lecture is recent collaborator Bugge Wesseltoft, a Norwegian mastermind whose became known for his New Conception Of Jazz in the early ’90s - particularly after working in several jazz outfits and recording with Jan Garbarek for ECM. Together, they discuss live improvisation, writing plug-ins, their studio set-ups, and more. 
Gerd Janson 
Now, we have two people, one from Berlin, one from Oslo, working together now,
coming from different backgrounds but sharing common interests. Henrik
Schwarz and Bugge
Wesseltoft, please give them a very
warm applause. [applause]
If one wants to pigeonhole and talk in cliches, one could say that Henrik
Schwarz is kind of a house producer, dance music guy, and Bugge Wesseltoft is
a jazz musician. But I would say both of you have been working on different
things as well and trying to mix it up a bit. Who wants to start?
Bugge Wesseltoft 
I’ve done several collaborations with people from the club scene, starting in
the ‘90s with a close friend of mine, a DJ from Oslo called Olle
Abstract. There was a great
place called Skansen and he launched this thing called “Superreal” in ‘96 and we did
a lot of live stuff. I loved it.
Gerd Janson 
So you’re no stranger to club land at all?
Bugge Wesseltoft 
No.
Gerd Janson 
Henrik has more of a DJ background, that’s what got you into doing music.
Henrik Schwarz 
Yeah, definitely. I was never a trained musician, I’ve always been super-
interested in jazz music and that was always a background for me. But I
started making music when I got a computer. I’ve been a DJ for many years and I started from that point.
Gerd Janson 
Bugge, you are also more-or-less self-taught, right? No classical studies?
Bugge Wesseltoft 
No, nothing.
Gerd Janson 
Maybe, to give people some idea of your music, shall we play something quick?
Bugge Wesseltoft 
Sure.
Gerd Janson 
This is Bugge Wesseltoft.
(music: Bugge Wesseltoft – “Dreaming” / applause)
So this was from your current album, Playing. Maybe you could talk about it a little bit about it and maybe also one of your first works, I believe it was called A New Conception of Jazz.
Bugge Wesseltoft 
I started to work with this type of music in the ‘90s, inspired by the
electronic music. My first group was a lot of people – horn section, guitar,
drums, acoustic bass, Rhodes. And I wanted to
make a band that played like a good DJ, because I was always going to
clubs and seeing how DJs worked with the music. I saw how they broke things down, brought it
down, just an amazing vibe to the whole scene, so I wanted
to make a band that played the same way. I was doing this New Conception of
Jazz thing for ten years, basically always jamming. We never rehearsed, we had
just two rehearsals in ten years. But after that I started this solo project,
which is basically what I do. I play piano and I have a laptop. What I love
about electronic music is it gives you new possibilities to improvise. To me,
it’s still jazz, still real-time improvisations, but with electronic gear it
gives me a lot of new things.
Gerd Janson 
But you’re also using sampling as a technique.
Bugge Wesseltoft 
Live sampling, yes, I record what I do on stage. What I love about jazz in
general is that it’s unique in that you create music on the spot. The audience
will experience something that never happened before. This is what I can do
with electronic stuff. The same thing with Henrik, we really try to create
good feeling, good things, good energy on stage.
Gerd Janson 
So it’s about improvisation?
Bugge Wesseltoft 
To me, it is, and I think to Henrik too.
Henrik Schwarz 
Yeah, definitely. It’s about the moment, finding the right moment, and when you have it you keep it.
Gerd Janson 
OK, before we start talking about how you guys work together, and finally
showing it with all the gear, maybe you could show us something of your tracks or remixes?
Henrik Schwarz 
You choose.
Gerd Janson 
I have to pick one?
Henrik Schwarz 
Yes, of course.
Gerd Janson 
Then maybe “Leave My Head Alone Brain.” You have it with you?
Henrik Schwarz 
I don’t have it with me.
Gerd Janson 
I thought you had it all in that marvelous computer.
Henrik Schwarz 
I have it live, of course, but I don’t have it as a file.
Gerd Janson 
You couldn’t put it together quickly?
Henrik Schwarz 
I could.
Gerd Janson 
Then we’d also have a quick example of how you work alone. [applause]
(music: Bugge Wesseltoft & Henrik Schwarz – “Leave My Head Alone Brain” live improv / applause)
Gerd Janson 
Where was the singing part?
Henrik Schwarz 
I’m training. I’ve been working on that, so it’s going to take a little while.
Gerd Janson 
Before you explain your set-up and working together in words, how did you two meet?
Henrik Schwarz 
Through a friend – he’s in the back – we both know him, Sven. He’s known Bugge
since quite a while and I met him because he was working for a record company and
asked me to do remixes, so that’s how I met him. And after a few years of working
together he just said, “You have to meet Bugge.” And he had the idea that this
could work and he was right.
Gerd Janson 
We’ve just seen it. Can you talk a little bit about what you’re doing? How you set it up together?
Henrik Schwarz 
We basically very often just start with nothing. Bugge was playing a concert in Berlin and
invited me to join him as a special guest for the last two tracks of his
concert. We did a rehearsal in the afternoon and we found out that by bouncing
back ideas we were getting somewhere really quick. That’s very often the start
for a new track when we play a concert together. Sometimes, there’s just a
good line and so for the next concert we keep that line and play around with
it.
Bugge Wesseltoft 
I think that live setting, when you don’t have too much planned, gives a
unique possibility. You have to be really focussed, it’s not like you’ve been
playing it for years and you just go out and recreate what you’ve done, you
have to be really focussed, trying to create something on the spot. This makes
a unique energy. It can be really shitty or it can be really good, too, and
when it’s good it’s really good. We’re trying to create as much openness as
possible. We have a brief rehearsal andthen we started to play. Basically,
it’s about interplay, it’s about listening to each other and trying to capture
the energy of the music, capture things that are in the room already.
Gerd Janson 
Is it different for you, Henrik, working with someone like Bugge, as opposed
to the Critical Mass project, which is you playing with
Âme and Dixon, the people who run
Innervisions?
Henrik Schwarz 
Yeah, of course, it’s a completely different set-up. The Critical Mass shows
are also about improvisation, but not that much. I have this set-up so I can
play as much as possible. So what I try to do is improvise with the laptop, so
I need to learn my laptop in a way as if it were an instrument, so that I’m fast enough. It’s also a
lot about speed, not too much pre-programmed stuff. I’m always trying to keep it as
open as possible, because if there’s a computer, you can easily fall into the
trap of playing pre-programmed material. But that’s not what’s the magic about
it when you play with a guy like Bugge, who can immediately respond and also give
something. Now, I have to respond immediately, or really fast. It really is
about the playing.
Bugge Wesseltoft 
I just think how amazing the development of electronic gear for the last ten
years. Just think about the ’90s, you had to load a floppy
disk, it would take a minute just
to change the sound. I bought my first sampler in the ’80s, the Emulator II and it was massive. I
used the case as my table in the living room. [laughter] It was unique, it
cost £6,000 and it had a double floppy drive, so while you were playing one
floppy drive you could load the other one without having to wait. So the
development is amazing and today you can really do live transformation of
sound recorded live. But still, this is just the beginning, it’s an ongoing
development and a lot of people in the electronic music scene use this for
everything and it will continue to develop. It’s great.
Gerd Janson 
So you wouldn’t sing that song of how technology changes the means of making
music in a way, a negative democratisation of it? Everyone can make music
and there are a lot of bad things and you should learn an instrument and all
these kinds of things?
Bugge Wesseltoft 
Are you asking me?
Gerd Janson 
Both of you.
Bugge Wesseltoft 
I love new things and I think talent will come up with new ideas on any tool.
If you look at how new ideas and directions in music have come, it is quite
often with someone finding some new gear and doesn’t perhaps know quite how to use
it and they use it in a different way suddenly there’s a new direction coming. I love new things and the
laptop is an instrument, absolutely.
Gerd Janson 
As Henrik would say, probably as well.
Henrik Schwarz 
I think it’s beginning to become an instrument. It’s been quite difficult
during the last ten years. You had to deal with processor power, you had to deal with crashes of
programs, but that’s going away now more and more and you can really play. I
have the feeling you can tweak this thing and see what’s coming out. I think the negative discussion about it is of course when you can press a button and
something is coming out anyway, that’s a bad thing. But still, maybe this one
button is sounding better than what happened 20 years ago. But that’s not enough
today. I think you really have to work and go new paths and explore where the machine can
help you create new things. But, of course, it’s still you who has to create.
The machine is not gonna do that.
Gerd Janson 
So if something is in you, it will come out?
Bugge Wesseltoft 
If you learn how to use it, yeah.
Gerd Janson 
Speaking of new technology, you also developed a tool that helps you working
with people like Bugge on the fly.
Henrik Schwarz 
I wrote a plug-in. There’s this new function called Max for Live for
Ableton. As I’m not a trained musician, I have learned what notes are during
all these years working with computers. It’s something I’ve learned by ear.
Still, when I want to go from one chord to the next chord it takes me quite some
time, so I always had a dream of having something that will help me find the
right notes and help me finding the right chords. Especially when I play with Bugge, I want to
improvise on the keyboard without having the fear of playing the wrong stuff
that sounds horrible. Some people like that, but I think it’s...
Bugge Wesseltoft 
I do. [laughter]
Henrik Schwarz 
Yeah, that’s the funny thing about it. I think if you want to play wrong,
that’s alright; but if you want to play right and play wrong, that’s not
alright.
Gerd Janson 
Say that again.
Henrik Schwarz 
I can’t repeat it. So I have this plug-in and it’s helping me to find the
right notes in real time, that’s what it’s about.
Gerd Janson 
Maybe you want to show it really quick, maybe it would make more sense in a…
Henrik Schwarz 
Yeah, I can open a new MIDI channel here. [stares at computer]
Gerd Janson 
And if any of you guys have questions along the way, feel free to raise your hands and wait for the microphone.
Henrik Schwarz 
I think most of you might know Ableton and some of you might know Max for
Live, too, it’s a very new thing they just launched a couple of months ago.
It’s something like a programming language inside the program. You can
create you own audio effects, like echoes or filters or synthesizers. There’s
also a second section that lets you create MIDI effects, things that handle
MIDI data or notes that come from the keyboard. You go to the computer and you
can do whatever you like with it. [pause as he keeps trying to set up computer] Crash. There it is. This is how it
looks. I need sound. I just take a basic piano and you can hear everything very easily
with that. So “Leave My Head Alone Brain” was the track we just played together and
that is made out of several chords, of course. What was always difficult for me
was the question of how can you find the rest of the notes – which ones are
allowed and which ones are not, so that the musician can play with you.
[demonstrates on the screen] What the plug-in does is it removes all the
wrong notes. If I press an E, for example, and it’s not part of the current
scale, it corrects it and plays a C in this case. It might not be right from a
musician’s point of view, but it works for me and that’s what it’s all about.
As a first step, I might not play many wrong notes with this, but there are
many, many different scales here,
Debussy or
Sakamoto. There will be a
function where you can create your own chords very soon. It’s getting
interesting when you can add more than just one note to your chord. For example, if I want
to play a chord out of three notes, I can just select it. [demonstrates on the
keyboard] For Bugge, it’s really easy to hear what’s going on here and join
this harmonic environment. And for me, it’s interesting to play in this
environment. It’s four notes and you can change the chord, spread it over the
keyboard. There’s also a slave to this, where maybe we’ll show that later when we
start to improvise over something like that. It gives me, as an untrained
musician – as an electronic guy who doesn’t know much about harmonics – some kind
of environment where I can play and improvise. It’s just a helper.
Gerd Janson 
How was the feedback on this when you announced it?
Henrik Schwarz 
Dramatic. Actually, I think it’s maybe one of the most interesting releases – because I see
it like a record – because it raised some serious discussion about if you have to be a trained musician or not. If this is complete crap or not. If
this is music that’s coming out, or if it’s the end of music.
Gerd Janson 
Someone said that.
Henrik Schwarz 
Some people were getting very angry about it. But I think it’s very important to do
things people either love or hate. If you do anything in between it’s boring.
If some people hate it, there are also a lot of people who love it. And that’s an
interesting thing that I like. I have also received a lot of very positive feedback from people
like myself who said, “Yeah, that was exactly my problem. Now I can go a bit into this a
bit and learn about how notes fit together.” That’s what it’s about.
Gerd Janson 
So do you think this also leads into caring more for it?
Henrik Schwarz 
How do you mean?
Gerd Janson 
If you don’t know anything about notes and scales and you start using
something like this, that you actually start to think about it also?
Henrik Schwarz 
You have to, of course. Still, this is not a jukebox. If you make enough
mistakes, it will sound shit. Of course. It’s just a tiny little helper and still you have to be creative. But you have to be aware that you have to create
something that hasn’t been done before. It’s not about playing a fantastic
piano solo, because there are other people who can do that much, much better,
and no computer will ever be able to do that. But I can maybe do some chord
combinations that are really hard to play and this could be something that’s interesting.
Gerd Janson 
So you still have to have an idea.
Henrik Schwarz 
Yes, you have to have an ear and an idea.
Gerd Janson 
And if you like the food, it doesn’t matter if it’s being cooked by a trained
chef or not. [laughter] Maybe we can do another live explanation.
[inaudible talk between Henrik and Bugge]
This is the set-up you would also use on stage?
Henrik Schwarz 
More or less, yeah.
Gerd Janson 
Or would there be other elements you’d add on stage?
Henrik Schwarz 
No, that’s the set-up. Normally, there’s a grand piano for Bugge. Maybe when
we start doing something new we might use this, or just bouncing ideas back and forth and see where it’s going.
Gerd Janson 
OK, let’s bounce.
(music: Bugge Wesseltoft & Henrik Schwarz – live improvisation / applause)
Do you have a kind of fallback repertoire for when something goes wrong?
Bugge Wesseltoft 
There’s an old saying in the jazz world: When everything goes wrong play blues
in F. [laughter]
Gerd Janson 
How would you explain to someone who doesn’t know a thing about laptops and set-ups what your role is in this and what Bugge’s role is?
Henrik Schwarz 
That’s a difficult question. I would just say it’s a duo that is trying to make some music, and that’s it.
Gerd Janson 
And your part is taking care of the rhythmic structure?
Henrik Schwarz 
It doesn’t always work like that. Sometimes Bugge’s hitting the inside of the
piano or playing rhythm with percussion instruments. Or we have a timbale with
us tomorrow, which is a rhythmic instrument. So basically there’s no rules, I would say.
Gerd Janson 
Have you thought of extending the set-up, with other people adding to it?
Henrik Schwarz 
We have Frank from Âme with us in
Amsterdam, which was nice too. But I have the feeling with the laptop you are
not a musician, it has its speed. It’s a limitation in a way but that makes it
more difficult to have more people involved.
Bugge Wesseltoft 
I think also the more people you have trying to create something together, the more
difficult it is. You have to be in contact with each other somehow, that you can
follow each other’s direction. If there are too many people trying to create
something together, it can be difficult. But when it works it’s great. It just
needs more rehearsal. This duo, what I love about it is it’s really open, you
can start from nothing and create something, just as we did now.
Gerd Janson 
So you would say – and I’m not sure this is a saying like that in English – but you have something like a blind understanding.
Bugge Wesseltoft 
We all have. Music is like communication. Music is like a good conversation. Sometimes you talk to someone and think this guy isn’t listening, he’s just talking to me. But if you are aware of each other, you have dialogue, you can create something good.
Henrik Schwarz 
Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t. It’s the most normal thing in the
world. It’s like when you meet people. When you meet somebody new, he might
become a friend, but you don’t know. One of how many people you meet is
becoming a really close friend? You don’t find people to make music with all
that often, just like you don’t find so many friends.
Gerd Janson 
So a match made in heaven.
Henrik Schwarz 
Yeah, it’s always a lucky thing when something like that happens.
Gerd Janson 
[addressing audience] And do you have any questions regarding improvisational things?
Audience Member
Two basic questions. I assume you weren’t synced, right? The computers aren’t synced? So when you do rhythmic stuff, the rhythm goes to him and he records you?
You’re always the master clock and there’s no sync, no slave clock. But all
the rhythm parts go through you?
Henrik Schwarz 
Well, it could be like that. We’re talking about if it makes sense to
sync the two computers. It’s a cool thing on the one hand because you don’t
have to care about the speed, but I’ve had bad experiences with synced
computers because they are not very tight. If you have two rhythmic elements
on two computers, then it’s not going to groove, it’s not really working. It’s
helping you sometimes, but sometimes it’s the wrong thing to do. I would say it depends on what you want to do.
Bugge Wesseltoft 
As long as you base the music on rhythmic structures there has to be a master.
We do sync through our wire network, but today we didn’t have time to set it
up. Normally, it’s sort of in sync. But the way I work when I play solo, I do
the same thing, but I don’t program. So I create things from scratch without
any preset tempos.
Audience Member
Like, all the rhythmic structure also from scratch?
Henrik Schwarz 
Yes.
Audience member 
I would love to see it. Could you walk us through your master chain? I saw millions of sends over there. Could you
walk us through your rhythm channel, master channel and return channels if we
have some time? [laughter] I’m really curious about that.
Henrik Schwarz 
Where do we start?
Audience member 
I don’t know, I’m so sorry. [laughter]
Bugge Wesseltoft 
I think his set-up is much more advanced than mine. Maybe you can explain your
set-up, I can explain mine afterwards. That OK?
Audience member
Great!
Henrik Schwarz 
When we play together the set-up is of course different from when I play solo. When I play solo it’s 14 tracks, three of them of them are drum tracks. But what is similar is that this is there in every channel, to have
an EQ already in the channel, even if it’s not used, it helps you save time.
When you need it, it’s there. So I try to pre-think what I might want to use. So
EQ is important. Maybe on other channels I have other effects. What is
different from the solo set-up is this thing here. [demonstrates on screen]
That’s all my main synths I’m using during the performance. It’s just my current
favorite selection of sounds, where I know I have these ten. One is an acid
bass, because sometimes that could be cool. One is a piano, a string or a pad
sound, just depending on what we do and where it’s going, ‘cause I don’t know
where we’re going. But it’s all about being quick. All the sounds that are
here, even if it’s drum sounds or pianos or organs or whatever, are all brought
together in these four main controls. It doesn’t matter which sound I play,
whenever I turn the cut-off knob, all the sounds are going to be changed. It’s
always the same knobs. That’s something I know. I don’t have to switch anything. And if there’s no echo
on the sound, nothing happens when I turn the knob. There’s also this button
here I call “drama,” it can be anything depending on the sound. But I know if
I want drama, I turn the knob. [laughter]
Gerd Janson 
Where do you get such a drama knob?
Henrik Schwarz 
It’s in every sound, in every synthesizer there is a drama somewhere, you just
have to find it. I try to find the drama in the sound and then I map it to
this button.
Gerd Janson 
That’s what all of you should do.
Henrik Schwarz 
Drama is important, especially in today’s club music, I think. There should be
some more drama. These basic controls, attack/release, that’s something you
can use for every sound. I know the sounds, of course, so I know what the
effect for this special sound is. Like these chains, they can be very long. [fiddles with controls] For
example, if we take this moonlight plucking sound, there’s another sub-patch, which
controls the actual synth, which is here. There’s a filter after the synth, and then after the filter there’s a delay. Here’s a volume control, that whenever I
turn the knob the sound might change dramatically. At the same time, I’m trying to, I don’t know, maybe the
volume goes up of the sound because the filter opens, then I already have
something that helps me keep everything under control. Again, it’s just a helper, so I
can play around with what it is and I don’t have to care about the volume.
That would be another reason to touch another control, but I don’t have time. Anything that can be pre-worked, where the computer can help you, I’m
trying to put into these things. And I end up with these eight knobs here, so
that it’s really easy to play around with it. It might be a totally different
set-up for another sound, but drama stays drama. 
Then I have some compression, just to get some more control. So that’s basically the main channel in here. And I might have some pre-programmed loops with a few notes here,
but there’s always a second channel — this is this one — where I can play the sound from the first
channel freely on the keyboard and also record. So there’s a basic loop
running, I can tweak the knobs and I can also add more notes and play. Then there
are a few basic loops I use for the track. I put all the basses into here. There’s
a battery and let’s say, there’s drums where also with one knob I can
jump between very different drum set-ups. I have a jazz drum kit, woods, an
orchestra, and just with the turn of one knob I can change everything without
having to load for many minutes. This is growing all the time. When we
play a new concert, while we’re playing I might think, “Oh yeah, I’m not into jazz or
orchestral or woods now, I’m into something else,” so I might load it while we
play. But then it stays in there for the next concert and then next time it’s
already there, it grows constantly. Here’s a classic
808, 909 – that’s important when we
play clubs. That’s the master and that’s very similar to the master I use when
I play solo. Here it’s all brought down to not too many knobs. It’s just a few
effects basically. It’s a delay. It’s an EQ. It’s a chorus. It’s a flanger. It’s a low cut
here, like on a DJ mixer, that’s important for me. Then I have control of
decay on hi-hats, that also adds some drama I think. I have quite a lot of effects on
the master channel because you can add some echo on one single sound when you
play, but it’s going to be hard for people to really realize because that’s a
tiny little change in the sound. If there’s a big audience they have to realize you
are working, especially if you are on a laptop. They still believe you are
checking your emails. That’s still not going away.
Gerd Janson 
But you don’t really look like you’re checking your emails.
Henrik Schwarz 
I work, I play, or I try to. I find it more dramatic if the effects are on the
master because then you turn one knob, people can see you’re turning a knob and people can hear you’re turning a
knob. I think that’s very important for the performance. It’s hard enough
that they believe you really play, instead of playing some pre-
programmed stuff. That’s why I have most of the important effects in the master.
Here’s a compressor, UAD – I have this little UAD card in the laptop because
the sound is fantastic. Like a fast compressor, a slow compressor and something
that helps make the sound better because it adds overtones and lets the
computer sound warmer and nicer. That’s about it. Ah, the send channels –
these are also very easy: There’s a delay, filter delay that gives me some
echo. Then I have different rooms, a small one, a synthetic one, and a real-
sounding one. One that’s far away, one that’s close, so you can easily place
the sounds while you play. It gives it some ambience to bring it more to the
front, or add some room to take it to the back.
Audience member 
Thank you. [applause]
Bugge Wesseltoft 
I have the same idea of a set-up, more simple, I think. I’m trying to
create things all the time, just to be possible to me to play around with some stuff and just record it. I
can show you quickly. All the buttons are assigned to something. I have an old
analog synthesizer that you can really twist and work around with while playing.
(music: Bugge Wesseltoft – improvisation)
I’m also constantly trying to make my set-up better. The whole Ableton-with-
the-Macs thing was just in the beginning. It’s getting better every day. I
really love it, I have to say.
Gerd Janson 
And have you ever thought of turning the both of you into one record.
Recording these sessions?
Henrik Schwarz 
Yes, we’re currently recording an album together. We have recorded already
quite a few things. We need to finish it now, there’s still some work to do
but there will be an album coming soon.
Gerd Janson 
Is that always the hard thing for you to do, to finish it? Or is that nothing
difficult for you?
Henrik Schwarz 
No, I don’t think so, it’s part of the game. If you don’t finish, you don’t
release, it’s simple as that. The harder question is how can you create something that’s worth to be finished.
Gerd Janson 
But that’s kind of similar, right, making a decision when there are endless
possibilities?
Henrik Schwarz 
Of course, but I would say for me the starting point is much more difficult. If there is something, for example if we play together, you can play for five or ten minutes and it’s alright but it’s not really going anywhere. Then suddenly, something’s
hitting you. The interesting thing is you agree on the same moment and that’s
what’s it’s about. If we agree, then they’re might be some other people who
agree, and that’s what it’s about when it comes to music in general. It
communicates with us and with others. It’s about finding these moments, and if
you have one, you have to be careful not to lose it, to treat it right and
develop it. But for me, the initial thing is to find these moments, that’s the hard
part. Because if you have it, it’s easy to finish it.
Gerd Janson 
The same for you?
Bugge Wesseltoft 
Yes. Same.
Gerd Janson 
That was an easy answer. [addressing audience] Any more questions from your side? 
Audience Member 
I wanted to ask, if you’re used to playing in the studio and want to make the transition to
live shows, how would you go about it? For someone who’s a trained musician.
Bugge Wesseltoft 
It’s basically the same thing. But of course live you have the energy from the audience
as well and you have the possibility of immediately getting an answer. Is this music good
or bad? You’ll feel it from the audience if they’re into it or if they’re not into it. I remember my
first band, and we really, really rehearsed – which I stopped doing, I hate
rehearsing. I mean, as a piano player, but not with the band ‘cause I really
want this live thing to be happening spontaneously, rather than be pre-
prepared. With my first band we rehearsed two times a week for a year and then we did our first show. At the rehearsal space we thought it was fantastic, the most incredible music
ever made. We did our first concert and nobody liked it. Because because it didn’t communicate – and communication is the essence.
Gerd Janson 
So you felt like the Blues
Brothers in that
country and western bar?
Bugge Wesseltoft 
In one way. [laughs] But you have to communicate with your music, and I
think that’s perhaps because you don’t learn that much in the studio, so you
have to go out there. That’s what I love, when I heard the club music when it
was really happening in the ‘90s. The way I saw it, there were a lot of young artists playing regularly out in
clubs, trying out their music all the time. When they felt it really worked on
an audience they’d release a 12". This is the way music has mostly been
working, in a live setting. For me, music is mostly important in a live
setting. As a performer, I like the live setting and this is what gives me the
option to play for so long.
Gerd Janson 
And Henrik, what made you start playing live? Because as I mentioned before,
you have a DJ background. You were a DJ before you started producing and the
way the “game” is these days, you could also just travel the world playing other
people’s records.
Henrik Schwarz 
Yes, I could do that like others do. I don’t know what actually made me do it, a force
from inside, I don’t know. I always wanted to make music, but I never learned
an instrument. So when computers came up, around ‘92, I think, a friend of
mine had a computer and I asked him, “Listen, when I buy a soundcard, would you let me try
some things out?” He said yes, so I bought a soundcard, plugged a mini-
keyboard in with a drum machine and it took me nine months to get one note out
of this thing. Somebody copied this program as a crack, and nobody at that
time had any clue about computer music.
Gerd Janson 
Do you remember the name of the program?
Henrik Schwarz 
Yes, it was Cubase Compact 1.0. It was a black-and-white thing and I didn’t know anything about MIDI and there was no audio in the
computer, of course, so there were all these cables. Yeah, but we struggled and
[eventually] there was a note coming and I remember this being one of the most
fantastic moments in my life. Then we were looping it immediately, of course,
like everybody else was doing. That was maybe the source for everything else. And, of
course, I began as a DJ, a local DJ at local clubs. A few years later I could afford
my own laptop. Immediately I thought, “Let’s put this beside the turntables
and play some loops.” That was what worked at that time – you could play four
mono tracks at the same time, maybe, and every five minutes the computer was crashing, but it was fun.
The software got better, the computers got faster, so for me, the computer
took more and more over, so it was a very natural process. At some point I
just felt I’d lost contact to playing other people’s records. When I heard
other DJs play, I though, “Ah, that’s a good record but I haven’t heard about
it.” So I leave it to them to find the good stuff and I’m happy with my
laptop.
Gerd Janson 
But when you did that DJ mix you did, you incorporated other people’s music.
Henrik Schwarz 
Of course. I love other people’s music and I like it when the DJ is playing.
But for some reason, it would be hard for me to go back, because I’ve been doing this for so many years. Whenever I get more processor power, I try to use it. That’s how I work.
Audience member
One of the things I’m interested in is acoustic instruments or “traditional”
instruments and how to use them in new ways. I noticed you’re using, for example, the piano
in a very experimental way. What advice do you have for people trying to take
the same approach?
Bugge Wesseltoft 
First of all, you have to have the idea that you would like to try something –
that’s the basic. Many are happy with what they do, while other people want to
try new things and develop and stuff. Personally, I’m just really into sounds. Like the piano, when I
play the acoustic piano, I still love it, it’s just a beautiful sound. But
also I like all the possibilities that are possible to make out of it. What I do is I’m sending a signal
from either the piano or the Rhodes into the laptop and then trying to build
as much possibilities as I can around that signal. Once it’s in the laptop, I
loop it and build new paths and new things from there. But as you say, the possibilities
are endless and it’s just to try out, I think. Then when you have it, you
should try it out. Of course, I can’t do everything live, but you have to have choices. You create something, do something with the piano, feel something nice, put it into the laptop, then you have some possibilities to move on with it.
Gerd Janson 
Anyone else?
Audience member
I come from a jazz background as well and I just want to know, do you think
this is how jazz will live on and be heard? What you guys are doing and what
other people are doing nowadays.
Bugge Wesseltoft 
I love jazz, too, I come from there. The great thing with jazz, historically
it’s always been developing. Maybe because we’re clever thieves and we have normally good ears, so we can hear things. The true history has always been bringing in new
elements, like after World War I, when the soldiers were in France and Europe in general and they experienced the gypsy jazz, which inspired them. It changed the whole American
jazz scene from a slow, New Orleans-type groove to a much faster swing.
Likewise, a lot of the American soldiers had an impact on the gypsy scene and
the European scene in general. Then you have the Cuban stuff. You have Miles
Davis in the late ‘50s when he lived in
Paris. I think he was tremendously inspired by the French impressionist music and made
Kind of Blue, which is probably
the most famous jazz album that ever came out, clearly inspired by French and European
classical music. Then jazz rock, now electronic jazz. So this, with the new
possibilities, this is jazz with the improvisation. Most instruments now, even
from classical, are expanding the possibilities of their instruments. From
playing just here [starts playing notes on the keybaord] you play [taps rhythmically on the keyboard, creating noise and echoes]. It’s constantly [developing] new things of
how to expand your sounds. For me, it’s about improvisation. The unique thing
about jazz is that you can create something for the moment. It’s music for the moment; that’s the
essential. Whether it’s swing or whatever, that’s the unique thing. To me this is
definitely going to be a part of the jazz scene in the future.
Gerd Janson 
There’s one more here.
Audience member
Thank you. It’s interesting that you say that neither of you had a traditional music
training. Have either of you worked with notation as far as classical notation, in terms of writing music?
Bugge Wesseltoft 
I have.
Audience Member 
Listening to your DJ-Kicks album, it seems a lot of your music, especially when you’re
performing live or in a situation where you like to improvise. It’s moving
away from music notation towards an oral tradition, where every time you do
something it’s performed differently. Is that how you see your music heading
towards?
Henrik Schwarz 
I wouldn’t say it’s heading towards it, that’s where it’s coming from. I don’t
know where it’s going, it could happen that next year I’m totally into reading
notes. If this happened next year, then I would learn how to read written sheet music and
try to play it. But I come from playing music by ear and that’s what I do so
far. If that comes to an end for me, then I’ll search for another direction.
Bugge Wesseltoft 
This for me is a new form of notation. You see more and more music in the
world – probably like it’s always been in the Western world – has moved from notation to playing.
Most of the music made today is made without notation. So it’s an interesting
dialogue also towards sampling. When someone samples a piece of music and turns it into
something else, you can look at that as playing a score from someone and then
turning it into something else. It’s just an interesting question. New
technology gives new ideas, new ways of making music basically.
Audience member
It sounds like you guys play in a lot of different environments, from clubs to
more standard stage settings. This Friday is going to be more of a “seats 
bolted to the floor,” stage kind of thing. Does that raise any issues to take into account for your
set-up? Like, when you were showing your software earlier and said the 909 and
808 are important for when you’re in clubs. Obviously, I’m sure you have
different ideas for different setting, so on Friday are you thinking about
anything special for the environment itself?
Henrik Schwarz 
I think that’s in a way also improvised. We go into the room, do a rehearsal and it could go
anywhere at any time; and we also listen to the audience. The 909 is in the
set-up, and if I need it, I use it. If I don’t need it...
Gerd Janson 
And the drama knob.
Henrik Schwarz 
Yes, and the drama knob is always there, so it’s totally open. So, of course,
the whole environment has a very strong impact on the music. The first time we
played together was the first time for me to play in front of a seated
audience. That was something shocking, but great, because I’m very used to playing in front of a dancing audience. And that’s fantastic in its own way, of course, but you have to keep them moving. To see a seated audience start to move because they wanted
to was something I really enjoyed too. But this environment had an effect on the
sound, so it’s just evolving somehow.
Bugge Wesseltoft 
I played at jazz clubs where it was mainly just men. Mature, male audience, And you could see if they recognized something they like, they just nod their head.
That was the highest achievement you can get. Or tap their foot. So I loved it
in the ‘90s when I started to play with these DJs because that was a really
fresh thing for me. Then, the concert halls again are different. The good
thing is you can do slow things, fast things. You don’t have to play one way.
That’s because when you play in front of a standing hall you have to be upbeat
to keep people moving. In concerts you can do various types of music. That’s
quite good, I think.
Gerd Janson 
If there are no other questions, I think we have to get moving, right? Or do we still have
some time? No, we don’t. The time manager is not approving. So please give these two gentlemen some big applause. [applause]

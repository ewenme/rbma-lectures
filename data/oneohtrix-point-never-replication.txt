Daniel Lopatin, operating as Oneohtrix Point Never, makes music that seemingly defies categorization. The son of Russian immigrants and professional musicians, Lopatin’s work is loosely connected to the noise circuit, but also draws influences from library records, jazz-fusion and his love-hate relationship with new age music. 
In his lecture at the 2011 Red Bull Music Academy, Lopatin discusses his musical background, his megalomania, his fear of being railroaded by drums and why he loves his old Juno 60 synthesizer.
TODD L. BURNS 
I’m pleased to be sitting next to Oneohtrix Point Never, so please give him a
warm welcome. (Applause)
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
Thanks, guys.
TODD L. BURNS 
I guess we should start with your hat, because it’s where you come from: Boston. Did you grow up there?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
I grew up in the suburbs outside Boston, like 20 miles west of Boston, and I went
to college in western Massachusetts, about an hour and a half west from
Boston. And then I returned to Boston and worked for a little while, then
moved to New York in 2008.
TODD L. BURNS 
What’s growing up in the suburbs of Boston like?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
It’s really mellow. There’s an undercurrent of puritanical stuff just ‘cause
of the history, so you get a lot of uptight people. And lots of Victorian
houses and then a lot of contemporary split-deck houses that were built in the
‘60s and ‘70s that are nice to look at and bike paths and trees, mostly idyllic
and academic oriented ‘cause of the schools and the history of that.
TODD L. BURNS 
Your parents were not religious though, were they?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
No, they were immigrants.
TODD L. BURNS 
First generation?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
Yeah, I was born here and they emigrated in 1982 from St. Petersburg. Their
priorities were such that they weren’t finding themselves in any religious
setting.
TODD L. BURNS 
Why did they emigrate to the States from Russia?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
It’s a complicated question. The short answer is [that] the feeling of being stifled,
in terms of opportunities, in the Soviet era was probably just too much for
them. They were young and both pretty ambitious. My sister was nine and they
had me on the way and I think they both saw better life opportunities, like a
lot of immigrants.
TODD L. BURNS 
You said your parents were ambitious. What were they doing?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
I think they just weren’t satisfied. My dad had a degree and was capable of
pretty high-level engineering stuff, but he found himself in a shoe factory,
just kicking around. That was the story for a lot of people. They were very
well-educated but kind of stifled. So for someone like my dad, he was perhaps
adventurous or just concerned about his kids’ future, to the point where
moving was realistic.
TODD L. BURNS 
He was already a musician before he came to the States, and your mother also
was a piano teacher?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
She studied classical piano when she was young and musicology. She was a
producer of a Soviet radio program, so she did a lot of research and fact
gathering. My father was basically on the other side of the tracks, having
grown up in the Ukraine, which is a very different landscape. His city, which
was a much smaller city, wasn’t ultra-cosmopolitan, so his upbringing was
tougher. He taught himself accordion and transferred that to piano and was in
a bunch of rock bands in the ‘60s.
TODD L. BURNS 
So you had high and low culture in the house?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
Yeah, definitely. For sure. And I think they helped teach other in a way.
TODD L. BURNS 
Early on your mother tried to teach you piano. She made you take lessons and
you weren’t too happy about it.
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
She tried. I was kind of a slacker. I don’t think I was really too different
than most kids I grew up with. I just wanted to be a monkey and hang out in a
tree and play video games. Certain things I still retain from the lessons she
gave me, just kind of basic harmony stuff. But I was terrible playing two
hands, I cheated all the time, I’d listen to her playing and copy it. In my
mind, I’m totally fooling my mom. I’m eight years old, I have no idea what I’m
doing, it’s totally wrong. She’s just sitting there like, “Just forget it.” But,
other little things, like recently someone noticed my hand posture – this was
someone that studied classical piano – and they were like, “Hmm, nice posture.” I had no idea, but it was something she probably instilled over and over by rote,
repetition, kind of instilled.
TODD L. BURNS 
At what age did you say, “Mom, video games – that’s where it’s at”?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
I’m not sure I ever said that. They did buy me a Nintendo, oddly.
TODD L. BURNS 
Why oddly?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
I just remember the shock ‘cause I never got any gifts, nothing. When I was
sick my mom would buy me a G.I. Joe or something, but only when I was sick.
But the Nintendo was an odd purchase. I was shocked, ‘cause it was expensive
at the time, about $150. It seemed out of their style.
TODD L. BURNS 
What were the games you were first into?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
Early Mario. I wasn’t into any obscure games or anything. I was really bad at
Zelda, I couldn’t find the
raft (laughs). All my friends could find the raft and I couldn’t. I would
watch my friends play video games – I think this is an important detail in my
stunning memoir. I wasn’t good at video games, but I liked the fantasy, the
immersive psychedelic experience, although I didn’t know what that was at the
time. I loved listening to it, I loved watching it and my friends were good at it,
and I’d watch them play. I was good at some games, like Mario Andretti’s
racing for some reason. My dad would just buy whatever was in the cheap
[section]. “Here’s this Mario Andretti racing game.” The worst game.
TODD L. BURNS 
Your dad was also playing music when he came to the States. He was keyboard in a band, or was he playing accordion?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
He was playing accordion sounds, presets. You have to understand, Russian
music is very provincial in a lot of ways. It’s basic and straightforward and
even their pop songs are sad, for some reason. He had some real success in St.
Petersburg in a band called Flying Dutchman. We found out in the last few
years there was a Russian Encyclopaedia Of Rock and his band was listed in the
top five or ten, I don’t know what it was. But it’s a big point of pride for
him. But he wasn’t able to stay in the band ‘cause he had a family and didn’t
want to drop out of school, so he de-prioritized that. But then throughout the
‘70s he jumped around in different resort bands, as I understand it, so he
would play these Russian countryside, lakeside… I think one band was called
Pelican. I can only imagine what these bands sound like.
TODD L. BURNS 
No recordings exist?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
No, there was one label, one government label. Either you were a government-
authorized band and you were on this label or you didn’t exist, pretty much.
Also, it was a covers band. He played in a lot of covers bands, and we think of
this as being a pretty trivial pursuit. That’s a game (laughs). But that
actually makes perfect sense ‘cause it’s a phrase.
TODD L. BURNS 
Describe your game, describes your father’s covers band.
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
The cover band in St. Petersburg at that time was really fancy stuff ‘cause nobody could get their hands on American or British music. So if you could play
The Doors or The Beatles you were basically this intermediary between life
behind the Iron Curtain and the rest of the world. But that was prohibitive.
TODD L. BURNS 
When he came to the States, was he was playing old Russian folk music to remind
people of where they came from?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
Yeah, they were little rock renditions of traditional songs. My dad is
super into Joe Cocker and he loves people that take a classic song and rework
it in their own way, repurposing. That’s what he would do in his band, or like Russian
versions of Western songs. In the ‘80s he had this band called Second Wind. He
was in his late 30s, early 40s, so they were like, “We’re over the hill, so Second
Wind.” And they wore these matching checkered sweatshirts. I think he was
having fun more than anything.
TODD L. BURNS 
Eventually, though, you got the keyboard he was using. At what point did that
happen? Or were you in bands before that?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
I was not in bands. I have a hard time being in bands ‘cause I’m a
megalomaniac (laughs). But my friends had a band, a grunge band, and the lead singer
played the saxophone and scatted like Anthony Kiedis or whatever.
TODD L. BURNS 
Doesn’t sound like a grunge band to me.
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
No, exactly. My whole upbringing was just all these confused, haywire
bad decisions. But that guy was Al
Carlson, who is our mixing
engineer, and the guitarist at the time, Joel Ford, is also someone who I work
with now in various capacities. So we all stayed really close friends and
grew up together, more or less. But I wasn’t accepted into the band because I
was supposed to be the bass player, arbitrarily. They’re just like, “You’re the bass player.”
TODD L. BURNS 
But you knew how to play bass?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
No, I didn’t know how to do anything, but I knew what the guitar looked like.
But they didn’t like my picking style ‘cause it was guitar. I didn’t play like
this, I used my thumb. So they rejected me. And then I went off on my own
thing, “my experimental period”, like 13 or 15… not really. Nothing interesting
happened, but when they caught up with me and we all converged and started
listening to these records, these jazz-fusion records in high school, our taste
started converging on that instead of Red Hot Chili Peppers or whatever. Then
I was useful to them.
TODD L. BURNS 
Seems that jazz-fusion is a pretty unlikely cool guy thing to be into at high
school.
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
There was nothing about us that was cool, and I still feel extremely awkward to
this day. Nothing has changed in that sense. The thing is, my high school wasn’t cool. There
wasn’t any punks or any indie rock presence. I was missing that entirely, I
didn’t have that perspective. The weirdest thing that was going on in my high school
was the theater kids doing pirouettes or reciting whatever. (Laughter) There was nothing
going on.
TODD L. BURNS 
Why don’t we play a song of nothing going on, a short one, but you’ve talked
quite a bit about this album being very important to you.
(music: Mahavishnu Orchestra – “Resolution”)
That’s pretty epic.
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
That was epic.
TODD L. BURNS 
What was that?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
That was Mahavishnu
Orchestra, a cut off of
Birds Of Fire, a record
my dad had taped on a Maxell tape with just a bunch of fusion stuff. Like he
had a Jean-Luc Ponty record, just ‘70s stuff that was jazzy. The thing that’s
important about all this stuff in general for me, I didn’t know at the time it
was a mainstream entry way into long-form jam music. I didn’t know Neu!
existed, I didn’t
know Kraftwerk, I didn’t know synth music was out there. So it was an entryway
into hearing textures that were unusual to me. I still love the music, I think
some of it’s cornier than others, but you can say that about krautrock or
whatever too.
TODD L. BURNS 
So it’s the textures more than anything else that got to you?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
Yeah, this album has [keyboard player] Jan Hammer on it and that track doesn’t really…
TODD L. BURNS 
Yeah, every other track was at least 10 minutes long, so we thought we’d go for
the short one. It’s not exactly representative of anything.
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
It’s good, though, it definitely works. But I loved Jan Hammer, I loved Chick
Corea, I loved synth players and the sounds of Arps
and Moogs, and at that
time even wrapping my head around… I didn’t know what I was hearing was a
sample-and-hold function. I didn’t know much of anything, but I would hear
these records and then the
[Roland] Juno 60 
my father had was in the basement, so I
would go down there and do my extremely crude imitations of Jan Hammer or a
[pitch] bender-laden solo or whatever. I was just piecing together, it was the beginning of me piecing together that vibe.
TODD L. BURNS 
A lot of people would listen to that and be like, “OK. Here’s riffs, or here’s the
complexity.” I’m interested in the texture being the more interesting thing to
you. Obviously, the music you make is very abstract.
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
Yeah, I don’t know what drew me to it. I think it was instinctual on some
level. I wasn’t being intellectual about it at that point in my life.
TODD L. BURNS 
Was that the first stuff you started making?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
Not really, I don’t know what I was making. I had such a rogue understanding
of chords and stuff. It didn’t all start coming together until I started
listening to radio and hearing contemporary stuff, and then hearing the
influences of stuff in contemporary stuff, hearing techno and hip-hop. There
was this college radio station, Emerson Radio, 88.9 in Boston, and they had
really good hip-hop shows and techno at night. Just basic, kind of drawing
parallels, there’s a scheme that’s a grander electronic music scheme, not
just… texture was important, I was definitely drawn to music that was more
abstracted.
I don’t know about you guys, but I have a hard time training
myself to listen to lyrics. I have an amazing appreciation for it now, but I’m
practically 30 now. It took me a long time to get to the point where I had the
capacity to listen to music for its lyrics, so a lot of the music I was drawn
to was just kind of… I wasn’t a lyrics guy. I don’t want to hear about your rock tale. I do now, in a way, it’s interesting to me, but at the time I didn’t really have
the capacity for it.
TODD L. BURNS 
So you go into the basement, you’re playing with this Juno 60. A lot of people who
start playing with instruments want to move on to bigger and better machines
that have real complexity, but the Juno 60 is a real love story for you.
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
Yeah, there are a couple of levels with it. One, it’s extremely sentimental.
Everyone has things they’re in possession of, or they’re in their family, they
have sentimental attachment to it. That’s one thing. Another thing is I
learned on it, so I can use it really effectively ‘cause I focused on it. One
of the things that overwhelms me to this day about gear is too many choices.
When you’re like, “Oh, I can jack with any VST possible, I can have this synth
from eBay or whatever,” you stop focusing on you, you just become this
obsessive gear hound. 
I’ve gone through phases like that where it’s this
addictive thing, where you want to absorb as much sound as possible and hear
as much stuff as possible and generate as much variety as possible. I don’t
mean to judge it in a negative way, but one of the things that fundamentally
shaped me was not having all those choices for many years, just having this
one thing. It becomes about you as a composer or an artist, however you want to put it. It becomes about you and the gear. So it helped me ‘cause it was a reflection, a mirror for me.
TODD L. BURNS 
Why don’t we listen to one of the first things you did as Oneohtrix Point
Never. It’s “Russian Mind”.
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
Definitely not one of the first things, but perhaps early. Depending when I
die, I guess.
(music: Oneohtrix Point Never – “Russian Mind”)
TODD L. BURNS 
Do you remember recording this?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
Yes, vividly actually. I had just moved to New York and it was my first
apartment, one I shared with a cat lady. I don’t know if they were feral cats
or what was going on. It was just fucking weird.
TODD L. BURNS 
How did you get into an apartment with a cat lady?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
I just needed a place and my bandmate at the time – I was in this synth trio
called Astronaut and my
bandmate Andy Plovnick knew of an opening in this basement apartment in Greenpoint, Brooklyn.
Upstairs was a totally happy scene and in the basement it was just fucking
terrible. Cats just peeing on the couches, and the closet was divided – this
is so informative for you guys – but the closet was divided. She had one half
of the closet and I had the other half, the other side. Occasionally in the
morning we’d be opening the closet at the same time. It was like something
that would happen in a romantic comedy but neither one of us would want to
look at each other and that would never change. So it was a brutal thing. 
This
track I did in the basement, it was one track, it was an Akai Headrush
Delay and the Juno, and it was the arpeggiator in latch mode and some delay setting and chord changes. That was one of the few times where I was… There’s a lot of chords there. I don’t even know how that happened, I was just trying to do fake counterpoint stuff. Also, I
was obsessed with this 
Dopplereffekt track called “Z-Boson” and this was my
“Z-Boson” tribute/rip-off track. But yeah, it was one track.
TODD L. BURNS 
This was early on in your recording career as Oneohtrix. When you were making
this stuff, did you realize that this was a different project, a different name, a different thing?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
No, I’d already been doing the OPN project in Boston for a couple of years.
This was actually my third proper release, so it wasn’t that new.
TODD L. BURNS 
When you first started creating tracks like this, though… You’ve had a couple
of other projects by yourself, and I wondered when you first created these
tracks were you like, “Oh, this is something else”?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
Yeah, on the first three records [which] were all compiled on this double-disc thing that [No Fun] put out called Rifts. The first four all had title tracks. The title tracks were always these
arpeggiator jams, and in my mind they were like little film themes. I was
really into soundtrack music, Bruton [Music] stuff and library records, stock music. A lot of what I was doing was
referencing that, and also Legowelt – Danny Wolfers and his arsenal of aliases doing film-oriented action adventure, like spy
movie music. So early on I was so into that and wanting to do it in my own
way. That’s where that palette came from.
TODD L. BURNS 
All the track titles are pretty evocative.
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
It’s all sci-fi, I was obsessed with Philip K. Dick.
TODD L. BURNS 
Betrayed In The Octagon.
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
Yeah, but a lot of the titles were… the thing is, they’re really jokey. I
don’t know if people think I’m on that but they’re kind of taking the piss a
bit. Still to this day, it’s not like, “I want to be an astronaut and travel to these…” I
just got a kick that there was this whole world of records made by these
dweebs with synthesizers, like me, that were imagined in these little studios,
outside of the mainstream channels, that were aspiring to the most epic, phantasmagorical shit. I loved that and just kind of gravitated towards that.
TODD L. BURNS 
So you’re constantly thinking about what this track is soundtracking?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
Yeah, kind of. I guess the way my brain is wired, I like to have a point of view.
TODD L. BURNS 
Does it come first, does it come in the middle or does it come last? The scene.
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
It can come wherever. It’s just a way of negotiating my way relationship to music and art and ideas. I don’t think the music is dependent on my personal
diary of little aesthetic ideas. I think they’re listenable records, they can
be good on their own, but for me personally it was a really good way of
getting psyched, getting engaged or having a point of view and believing in what I was doing. Even if those things were like ephemeral and subject to change, just
whimsical or whatever or jokey. For me, it was like… I really needed that.
TODD L. BURNS 
Why?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
Because it makes me more in the moment, it makes me play better. I realize
it’s not for everybody, but for me there’s an urgency to playing music. I want
to push this weird corollary idea forward. Maybe I’m oversharing, but I tend
to do that, I’m verbose about this stuff in general, but the best suggestion I
can give is for people that want to do electronic music, find your reason to
do it. Whatever that reason is, just own it and love it. ‘Cause your point of
view matters, you’re a human being. Your point of view matters. That’s
something that music gave me, too, it’s a way to engage with the world and be
creative on your own terms. It’s good to exercise that part of your brain.
TODD L. BURNS 
You put up a bunch of YouTube clips on my computer and I don’t know what any
of them are. However, I think what you just said might relate to one of them.
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
There’s so much cool stuff, but you’re right, this is one. This is Werner
Herzog, part of his film Burden Of
Dreams, which is a documentary about the making of the film where they drag the ship over the hill. What’s it
called?
TODD L. BURNS 
Fitzcarraldo.
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
Right. I think this is a clip from Burden Of Dreams, I’m pretty sure. Him
and [Klaus] Kinski, the actor, they were really tight but they were also clashing a
lot. They’re passionate guys and, I think for me, seeing the Burden Of
Dreams documentary – not even his film, I didn’t even see the film till much later – but it was like, “Holy shit, people that are good artists have a point
of view.” It’s not about whether they’re right or wrong, it’s completely
debatable, but the spirit or the intensity of this man is such that it’s
undeniable that he’s doing his thing, he’s working his methods out.
(video: Burden Of Dreams)
TODD L. BURNS 
Do you ever get to that point in your music-making process of this (referring to Herzog’s voiceover) “obscene”…
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
Yeah. The thing is, I was listening to so many new age records, and they’re undeniably bad records, but there’s something about them I was listening to and enjoying. But I was fixated on this idea that you could use the tropes of new age music to describe something beyond the cliché that is new age music, like chill out and be in your Zen-like cave amongst nature. I don’t even like that, I don’t go to the woods or whatever, I don’t do anything. But that’s an interesting idea
that people would want to do that or make music that created a simulated Zen
forest vibe. I was like, “That’s a terrible idea, you should never do that.” What I was
trying to do, whether I did or not I don’t know, but what I wanted to do was
make music that implied certain aspects of new age but was pretty sinister.
TODD L. BURNS 
You talked a little bit about Returnal, which was a record that was after Rifts, being your [Jean-Jacques] Rousseau record, the painter. Can you talk a little bit about that and
explain what that means? ‘Cause I think it’s this simulated world thing a little.
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
Just the idea that Rousseau never…
TODD L. BURNS 
He’s a French painter from the 19th century.
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
Yeah, he’s a French painter during this exoticism period. They’re very interesting. They’re not one-to-one depictions of nature, explicitly because he didn’t really like or appreciate nature. So, I was drawn to that, like, “Woah. That’s kind of a vibe.” Does that explain it?
TODD L. BURNS 
Sure. Why not?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
I just get in these things where like, if I start going down this rabbit hole it’s
the only thing we’ll talk about.
TODD L. BURNS 
We can go down the rabbit hole.
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
It’s OK.
TODD L. BURNS 
Tell me about that record, Returnal. It seems like it’s the one that brought
you to a wider audience. Were you in a basement apartment with a cat lady
recording that?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
I was at my parents’ home one summer in between grad school years, between
years one and two at grad school.
TODD L. BURNS 
What did you study at grad school?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
Library sciences. I wanted to be an archivist. I recorded it at home in an air-conditioned room.
TODD L. BURNS 
You recorded it during summer. Is the season important to you?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
No, because I run so hot. I don’t like summer at all. My friends all know this
about me. I hate summer because I sweat so much. I wanted to make this Rousseau
jungle painting record inside my parents’ air conditioned home.
TODD L. BURNS 
Why don’t we take a listen to one of the tracks from that record?
(music: Oneohtrix Point Never – “Returnal”)
Who’s that singing?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
That’s me. (Applause) Thanks! Wow! Not even my parents do that (laughs).
TODD L. BURNS 
So your room is on the second floor and you come down and say, “Mom, Dad, come
and listen to my new record”?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
No, I’d be far too embarrassed to sing in front of them. Basically, the record was
finished and there was no title track. There wasn’t this track. I sat on it
and I sent it to Carlos Giffoni at No Fun and he was like, “Ah, I don’t like this
record.” I sent it to [Editions] Mego and didn’t hear anything back for a very long time,
and that gave me a lot of time to think about what I’d done and I was like, “Oh,
there’s something missing.” By that time I was back in New York, but I think
also I wouldn’t have recorded it at home. But I recorded that in Brooklyn.
TODD L. BURNS 
So the first person you sent it to was Carlos. Why?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
He had basically enabled my whole thing.
TODD L. BURNS 
In what way?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
He reissued my first recording, my tape Betrayed In The Octagon, on vinyl.
He put out Russian Mind, which was another record. Then he did the Rifts
anthology. He’d been really instrumental.
TODD L. BURNS 
How did you get in touch with him originally?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
I sent him tracks through a messageboard. There was a noise messageboard that
still exists called “I Heart Noisetroniks” or
something. I didn’t know how else to reach him, and his MySpace quote – remember on
MySpace they’d have these quotes by your name? His was like, “Do not ask me to
play your festival.” That’s what it said and I was like, “Fucking asshole!”
TODD L. BURNS 
The stuff you’re making is not noise, but you’ve gotten caught up in that
scene.
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
The thing is, by the time that Double
Leopards, which is a group that
inspired me a lot, were doing music that is not noise either, but is definitely
situated among the global noise community. That whole style and approach to
structuring improvisational music, that’s what I was exposed to with Double
Leopards and stuff like that. So noise as this fist-pumping thing was not for
me, but there were already bands doing interesting variations on that, but
still using the structural approaches of noise to make different kinds of
music, free, improvised music.
TODD L. BURNS 
Do you think that Double Leopards were one of the bands that helped that along
changing its mindset, the noise community?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
Yeah, undoubtedly. I’ve rarely met a band in my generation of kids making
peaceful – not really peaceful, but gentle – noise music that don’t talk about Double
Leopards. Then they went on to form Religious Knives, which was basically a rock band
with vocals. They were always, “I don’t give a fuck.” They just do whatever
they want. And that was super inspiring for sure.
TODD L. BURNS 
Carlos is obviously wide open ears. Why do you think he didn’t like this album? Did he explain further than “no”?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
No, he doesn’t explain, he’s a man of few words, but he doesn’t pander to
anything. He won’t put stuff out just because… He puts stuff out that he
likes. So ultimately, it was 100% OK, and I really appreciate that about him.
TODD L. BURNS 
So why Mego next? Had 
Emeralds already…?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
It’s funny, it always seems Emeralds will put out a record on a label, then
I’ll put out a record on a label. So I’m always in their kangaroo pouch
or whatever. I don’t know, there’s just so few record labels that I knew about
and respected or felt psyched about, so yeah. I knew Mego was out there.
TODD L. BURNS 
They seem in the past couple of years to have really opened up again to
different artists. They had a coterie of, like, Peter [Rehberg], who runs it, and
Fennesz and all these European guys. Now you have Americans coming over and
doing stuff.
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
I think Peter is a lot like Carlos in that way. He’s not somebody that panders
to an idea of what he’s supposed to be. Mego represents certain things to
certain people. There was an era when they were brutal, digital, Russell Haswell, Florian Hecker. There’s a very distinct
sound with Mego that’s interesting. But Peter himself, his roots are very
humble in a way, he’s a person that’s very familiar with punk rock. He’s a
down-to-earth guy. [If] he gets interested in something, and he feels like it’s worth
putting out, he does it.
TODD L. BURNS 
I read an interview with you where you said you emailed him about possibly
doing a remix album and you said, “I wanted that Mego vibe,” and he told you, “I
have no idea what you’re talking about.”
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
Yeah, he denies it. What I meant was… I shouldn’t have written that email. I
write a lot of emails I shouldn’t write. But I was like, “Wouldn’t it be cool if
Florian Hecker and every single dude from Mego patted me on the back and told
me I was awesome?” Which is basically what remixes are. There are other things
too. But I think his response was more just like, “Fuck off. Come on.”
TODD L. BURNS 
So why did your latest album with Ford [& Lopatin], you did an entire remix album?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
That wasn’t really my idea. (Laughs) It’s fine, it worked out fine. The remix record
sometimes can be really cool. In the case of the F&L [Ford & Lopatin] record, the songs are
so varied, the stems are really interesting. There was a lot of room for
seeing it become more dance edit-friendly, so it made sense in that case. But
would I personally do a remix record again? Maybe not.
TODD L. BURNS 
What is your approach to remixing? Have you done a lot of remixes?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
Here and there.
TODD L. BURNS 
Does there have to be something you like in the original?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
It’s very difficult, yeah. There has to be some element there that’s salvageable. I’ve
noticed that a lot of the remixes I do sound the same, I think I’ve done one
remix of many different artists, so I’m like, “Maybe I shouldn’t do these anymore.” My recording approach is pretty raw, or had been, so it’s difficult to massage
what I do into a context that I think is like… There’s a factory, industrial-
style approach to remixes that works. You cut stuff up in Ableton, you work
things or you make them fit. You make a club edit or an ambient edit or whatever.
I find it to be extremely challenging for me personally because I don’t
necessarily utilize those tools that well or in that kind of way, so it’s
tricky for me, the remix thing.
TODD L. BURNS 
You said your recording process used to be raw, more raw. How’s it changed?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
The last record I made, Replica, we made it in a studio in a more or less
professional environment (laughs).
TODD L. BURNS 
Why do you laugh?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
Just because we were having a lot of fun. You’re in a studio, you’re learning
the technology on the go. I’d become somewhat familiar with Pro Tools from the
F&L record prior, so there was a level of comfort with Pro Tools that
was new to me. Even during [Ford & Lopatin’s] Channel Pressure, I wasn’t zipping around the tracks
fixing stuff fast. I think the true mark of whether you’re good at Pro Tools
is how fast you are at it (laughs). Then kind of understanding what Al, our
mix engineer was doing and what he could bring.
TODD L. BURNS 
Al seems pretty important to the sound.
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
Yeah, he’s super important.
TODD L. BURNS 
What does he bring to it as a mixing engineer?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
Bass. We just listened to “Returnal” and I was like “Oof!” I heard this and there
was sibilant stuff, it’s very mid-band heavy, it was recorded in GoldWave in
Multiquence. I don’t know if you guys know about it, but it’s not worth
knowing about basically. But I’ve actually used those two programs in
conjunction with each other for many years. So, Al, Al being super creative, but
he’s also just a scientist. So he’s like, “Yeah, I want to make your record and
bring out the whole spectrum. I want it not to be so mid-band heavy and to
have low-end and interesting top.” Basic stuff like that.
TODD L. BURNS 
Have you learned a lot from him or do you just go, “Go ahead, take care of it for me”?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
No, you can’t do that with an engineer, I don’t care what engineer it is. You have to mitigate it but at the same time there was a lot of jamming he was doing. We would do a lot of performance, one-take sampler performances. A
[Roland] SP555, and I would just play the pads, I had an idea of an arrangement in my head. And
while I was doing the arrangement and a take in the hopes that it would work,
he was on a Sherman Filterbank and just shredding my
555 signal on another track. So there was that interaction and he was jamming,
‘cause he was learning the Filterbank during that session too. That became a
big sound on that record, all the super-coarse sounds like audio being
ripped, super low-end and fuzzy weirdness.
TODD L. BURNS 
Shall we listen to a track that exemplifies that?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
Yeah, we can listen to “Nassau.” The Sherman Filterbank comes in later, you
can hear it. You can cut to the middle. This one’s mostly about low-end.
(music: Oneohtrix Point Never – “Nassau”)
(Applause) Thanks guys, that’s very sweet of you.
TODD L. BURNS 
It’s pretty physical.
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
Yeah, that’s definitely what changed.
TODD L. BURNS 
You put it out on your label, Software. Tell me about forming your own
label and what that means. Are you going to put out records by other people or
just your own stuff?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
Yeah, the idea was basically to have an imprint that was administered by a
label that…
TODD L. BURNS 
It’s Mexican Summer, right?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
Yeah, so Mexican Summer administers the label and basically is teaching us how to be a label and also is using their distribution arm to get our records into shops and
make it visible to people.
TODD L. BURNS 
Seems like a really interesting business model. I don’t even know if it’s a model exactly.
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
It’s really cool, it came around the idea of them having a studio in their
offices, which is a very rare thing. When I was talking to labels, what was
being offered was good but not musically inspiring. It was like, “This is
cool,” but they’re pretty straightforward arrangements. But I really don’t
have the money, even if I take a deal with a label that on the surface is a
good fit, I still to have spend tens of thousands of dollars on studio time to
have that luxury of being in a studio without feeling pressured. “Oh, we’ve got to pack up and go?” So I really wanted to indulge in being in the studio environment for as long as I needed.
TODD L. BURNS 
How long did you need?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
I don’t know, it was an experiment. Channel Pressure took three and a half
months or something because we were also learning about that studio. So those three and a half months cut down on the time it took to do Replica because we had learned certain things. The main thing I’m trying to say here is that it was enticing me not because I want to have a label or there’s a profit motive to the label – it’s because it allowed me to have more ownership, to be closer to and have access to this really beautiful studio that’s down the street from where I live. And that’s something I valued and still value very much. It’s been a good thing.
TODD L. BURNS 
Why did you want to get in the studio so badly? As someone who does home
recording, I would think you’d be comfortable setting up in your bedroom. It
seems very important to you that you got there.
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
It’s OK, but I wanted to make a record that sounds fuller. The studio is like
a rock studio. That’s the thing that is important. This is an electronic music
studio set-up you guys have here. But basically you have these stations – other than that
main control room, live room area with the board and the Mellotron or
whatever – you have these little bedroom setups, you even call them that. So what I wanted was an analog studio with the classic studio
amenities, rock amenities, but to be making electronic music there. I thought that would make
for something really interesting sounding. That’s what appealed to me. And it’s
a very interesting space, kind of psycho-geographically. You’re locked in this
amazing dungeon that’s dark and there’s a piano and a Neve console and a wet
[live] room and really comfortable couches. It puts you in the zone, a focus zone.
TODD L. BURNS 
Do you have trouble focusing?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
Yeah, I can’t be in the studio all day. It’s not like it’s my studio. So when I’m
doing stuff at home, I find that having to… it’s not even just the space, although
working on headphones all the time can be super oppressive on my brain. Having
to switch things on and off and set stuff up and be the engineer and the
performer at the same time is distracting. When we talk about, like, “Oh,
music has changed so much, you can make these records at home,” that’s true,
but there’s something to be said for the old school approach where it’s just like,
you’re there to perform, to make a record, you don’t fuss around with the guts
of an operation. For me anyway, it can totally kill the vibe. It’s a mood shatterer.
TODD L. BURNS 
You said it was a rock studio, but you created your own vibe? You brought vibe
creators in? Lots of incense and curtains and… ?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
Exactly. [Pink] Floyd posters? (Laughs) We brought our synths in ‘cause we had a lot of them.
TODD L. BURNS 
How many did you have?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
Between the three of us, we probably have 20 different synths. We have a lot of
the same kind of stuff. We have some rack gear. When Al got in there he slowly
brought his whole studio in and he’s been working there steadily for the past
year now. He’s working with other bands, he’s working with Peaking Lights,
Yeasayer recorded their record there. So Al’s been there and made it his home.
TODD L. BURNS 
Why don’t we play a record from Channel Pressure, You keep mentioning it. This
is a joint project with your friend Joel Ford, who’s also in Tigercity.
(music: Ford & Lopatin – “World Of Regret”)
Most of the people in this room I guess won’t know Tigercity that well. [This]
seems to me like a continuation of what Joel was doing in that band. You don’t hear a lot of what you might have brought to the table on that song.
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
It’s kind of a White Album thing going on where some songs were more driven
by Joel, some by me. But whatever ideas were on the table, both of us were
kind of throwing a lot of stuff together.
TODD L. BURNS 
So where would we hear you on that song?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
All over the place. We used the [Roland] Gaia synth to get the weird scat dad sounds. This song’s cool. It grew on me. It’s definitely like
we wanted to do almost this J-pop, cartoony thing and to have this overload of
interesting synth moments, like Thomas Dolby style, where he’s showing you all
these little strange…
TODD L. BURNS 
Like, “Here’s what I can do with this synthesizer”?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
Yeah, but in a really fun way that’s not wanky, just creating a zoo of little synth emotions and shapes. Yeah, I think I played most of the synth on it, some of the weird My Bloody Valentine string things. Usually Joel is doing all the drum
programming, and all the basslines generally. Some basslines I do.
TODD L. BURNS 
You said earlier that you're a megalomaniac. How does this [collaboration] work?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
It’s hard! It’s hard working with other people. Joel and I have a comfort
level because we’ve known each other for a very long time.
TODD L. BURNS 
You did a record recently for RVNG as well, a
collaborative record:  James Ferraro, Laurel Halo, David Borden, who’s been around for a
long time doing synth stuff. Can you talk a bit about the process and how it
works? There was also someone else involved in this record.
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
Yes, Samuel Godin, who is David’s stepson. I was
approached by RVNG and asked to do one of their
FRKWYS series that pairs different generations of artists together. And I
really loved David Borden, I thought he was an unsung hero in a lot of the
conversations about synth music. Interestingly  enough, he has about a minute-and-a-half of music in The Exorcist. But he was mostly this guy who was totally
doing his own thing in the ‘70s, he was in Ithaca, a very close cohort of Bob
Moog
. Moog would give his band, Mother
Mallard, the beta test of
all his music stuff as it was coming out. They were all very close and there
was this network of people up there at that time. But he never moved to New
York. He was basically on the outskirts of the minimalist scene. There were
Steve Reich and 
Philip Glass, and those guys knew him and he knew them as
well, but he was like, “I’m gonna stay here in Ithaca and do my thing.” But he had
some very interesting records. What’s interesting is that they’re played
through manually by his band or him solo. There’s no sequencing. It’s almost
mathematical.
TODD L. BURNS 
How did you approach working with him?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
I knew I wanted to get a lot of other people involved because I thought it
would be fun to step outside this specter – is that the word? – of two people. I just didn’t want it
to be like Tekken, like, “In this corner, David Borden.” It just seemed lame. I just got people together who I thought would be fun and also enthusiastic about synth music.
TODD L. BURNS 
It’s a really cohesive record. With five people involved, I’m wondering how
that worked.
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
It was all about laying back, like jazz style. You really have to allow other people to
breathe and listen. The most interesting thing for me was doing what I do and
having this improvisational approach with other people and not overplaying.
Everyone was so giving and allowed each other to do their thing that they
created. When five people are all holding back, it’s really cool. It’s almost like
someone’s supposed to take the lead or whatever. But it created a really interesting ambient sound.
TODD L. BURNS 
The other collaboration we should talk about before we open it up to questions is Antony [Hegarty, AKA ANOHNI], who sang another version of “Returnal.” Is that right?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
Yeah.
TODD L. BURNS 
How did that come about?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
He’s a really polite guy and he emailed Carlos and asked permission. “Can I
email Dan?” That’s the nature of Antony, his character, he’s an incredible
person. He had seen some of my videos and apparently it was the videos.
TODD L. BURNS 
The videos on YouTube?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
Yeah, he saw my Sunset Corp YouTube
account stuff and thought it was cool.
TODD L. BURNS 
And what do you make of what he did with it?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
It was amazing. The cool anecdote that I can say about that is he tricked me. He said, “I’m gonna do this cover.” I was like, “OK, cool. Are you going to do all the
parts?” Then he was like, “Hey, I’m doing it. I’m at the studio in Manhattan now. You
should come down.” I was like, “Cool, I’m going to get to watch this incredible
musician play one of my songs and hang out.” So I went down there and this is
cool, I get in there and he’s like, “Piano. You!” And I’m like, “Fuck!” I
didn’t even know how to play the fucking song, I had no idea. But I figured it
out, and he was really supportive and amazing. What’s funny is how sweet to me
he was, but how aggressive and intense he was with his vocal takes. He’s
extremely efficient and he can basically just jump in at any point, he has an
amazing memory. And the speed and the language he uses. The man is seasoned.
Seeing that was incredible. I was just like, “Phew, I’m too slow and stoney.”
TODD L. BURNS 
Do you think you’ll ever get that way in the studio or are you just too stoned
out?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
No, I’m not that stoned out. [Laughs] I guess I could, but the thing is, he’s such a
talented singer and pianist. Even on a keyboard, I have to deploy so much
trickery to make things sound right. I have to kind of lie and combine little
bits. I’m sure you guys know about this. It’s an electronic music thing, a
lot of us aren’t really natural musicians. Some of us are. It’s a lot of multi-tracking and lies.
TODD L. BURNS 
Did you show him your piano posture, though?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
I don’t remember. I was so nervous.
TODD L. BURNS 
Why don’t we watch one of the videos from your Sunset Corp thing and then open
it up to questions after that?
(video: Sunset Corp – “nobody here”)
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
That’s all it’s gonna do, so…
TODD L. BURNS 
It’s very beautiful though. (Applause)
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
Thanks, you guys are too sweet.
TODD L. BURNS 
Does anybody have a question they’d like to ask?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
Shall I do the pointing?
TODD L. BURNS 
You don’t have to.
AUDIENCE MEMBER 
You were talking earlier about how sometimes when you’re creating your music,
you have little flashes of a film score or something. If you were given the
opportunity to totally rescore a movie, what would you pick? Wipe it clean and you do it.
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
I don’t know, that’s a tough question. Did you hear my Michigan accent for a
second there? My girlfriend’s from the Midwest. (Adopting Michigan accent) I don’t
know.
AUDIENCE MEMBER
Or just a genre?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
Comedy. I think there’s room for much better music in comedies. Tim Burton’s
films are incredible. Who does his?
TODD L. BURNS 
Danny Elfman.
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
Elfman, yeah. That’s great, but I don’t really like the orchestral stuff that much. That
would be cool with like Pee Wee’s Big Adventure or something with a really
sinister… That’d be cool. Something lighthearted in a sense, but absurd.
TODD L. BURNS 
I thought you were thinking romantic comedies. Put a sinister score under that.
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
That would great too, that’s fucking awesome, like some Jennifer Aniston shit
(laughs).
AUDIENCE MEMBER 
The first track on Returnal is quite noisy, almost intimidatingly so. Did
you think about that when you were doing it? ‘Cause it’s upfront. If someone
went into the store and listened to the record they might think, “First track,
blistering noise.” Was it meant to be controversial or was it just one of the
songs you made and that’s where it goes?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
A lot of people think I’m just doing that on purpose to take the piss and
scare people away. But I wasn’t doing that. I wanted to establish it, like in
a film where the first shot is exposition that gives you a sense of location
and then it goes into the character world. I wanted to start with this hectic
world that gave way to this other place. So that was pretty strategic.
TODD L. BURNS 
Did you record it first?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
Um, yeah. I don’t remember, probably. No, I knew I wanted to set it up that way. I don’t know if I recorded it first.
AUDIENCE MEMBER 
I’m curious to know when you got into sample chopping instead of the straight
synth and if you see any correlation between the two things.
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
The first thing I chopped was a [jazz fusion group] Return To Forever jam. Was there an old
Roland sampler, the MS something? Whatever. It was big, it was grey, it had a red
button on it. I chopped up some Return To Forever jams.
AUDIENCE MEMBER
“La Fiesta”?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
I don’t know, it was something on No Mystery, I can play it. But this is
the thing that got me into sampling, was this fucking track. He’s just a
genius.
(music: Gang Starr – “Robin Hood Theory”)
This is in high school for me, but I didn’t really have the technical know-how, the
approach or the gear, I just wasn’t there yet. But I always wanted… Even with
his melodic sense, the aesthetics of the cut, this sort of alien asymmetrical
thing. (Waits for the beat) That. (Stops music) So even though I wasn’t doing that, I
was. I didn’t have a sampler, but I was chopping things up – I would do noise
collages. Then I would chop things in GoldWave that had this swing to them.
That’s probably something a lot of you guys do. The only difference now is
it’s probably more explicit. Before I always wanted to make these songs, but
chop them in a way that there was a swing or a color to it.
TODD L. BURNS 
Who are some of your favorite hip-hop producers?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
[DJ] Premier is the dude for me forever. He’ll always be the guy. And RZA, Liquid
Swords, basically. But Premier was the guy. RZA came later, but when I heard
this record, Moment Of Truth… I still listen to this with complete
fascination and concentration, I just think he’s one of the best out there.
AUDIENCE MEMBER
You were talking earlier about artists having an opinion and a reason to create work. Can you elaborate what your reason is, perhaps?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
No, it’s hard to. It can be independent of an overall ethos or something. It
can be, “What’s my approach to this project, what’s my approach to this hook?”
I’m fundamentally concerned with stylizing what I do: styles, music history, the music historical context of music, music that is about music; that’s sort of the bedrock. So I’m a fan first. I don’t know if you guys saw James Pants last night, but I was totally blown away by his set. His point of view is his love of music, period, so that resonates with me. There are other things that are more specific to a project or an album or a track, but approaching things from a music historical context and integrating that into what I do is very important.
TODD L. BURNS 
With the new album, what was the music historical [context]? Seems like maybe new age was
a big thing to you.
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
Maybe in previous records it was new age or library records, stuff that was
thrown to the wayside. In a way the new one as well, in the sense that I
sample a lot of commercials that are basically crap. Ephemera. So using stuff,
making new use, repurposing stuff that is otherwise subjugated to be ignored
or made irrelevant. And rightly so. But to me, it’s like the way Native
Americans would use every part of the buffalo. You don’t want to waste all the
stuff that’s out there ‘cause some of it can be pretty enlightening or
interesting or reveal certain things about who we are and what we do as human
beings. So mining all these commercials I sampled was a revelatory process of
getting closer to the hidden secret messages.
TODD L. BURNS 
What part of the buffalo were the commercials?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
That’s a really psychedelic question (laughs). I don’t know. The butt. I mean they’re
commercials, so it’s tough. They don’t want to be good, they’re not good. They
are noise and they’re oppressive in their purpose.
TODD L. BURNS 
Definitely the butt.
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
The butt, or some sort of cancerous growth on it, I don’t know.
AUDIENCE MEMBER
The Oneohtrix stuff that you do doesn’t have much drums on it. Was that an
aesthetic decision or was it just that drums are hard?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
Drums are very hard, I’m not good at them to be honest. I never was. It’s my
air instrument. Whenever I fantasize about coming back in another lifetime, I’m
a drummer and I’m wearing mesh shorts and just pounding away. It’s incredible.
I think there’s a way to insinuate rhythm without having severe drum skills.
AUDIENCE MEMBER
I know what you mean, using arpeggiation or all sorts of things, but let’s say
that tomorrow you wake up in your mesh shorts and you’re an awesome drummer.
Would you have drums on that stuff? Or have you developed rhythm in such a way that now it’s done?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
I know what you mean, but I don’t think so. Not in this lifetime. What I’m
good at doing is creating this slightly offset space, this space that’s my own,
and part of it is when you have the rhythm track that’s hard, that’s fixed,
you’re on rails, in a way that I’m never comfortable with in my musical
context. But clearly, Premier is fucking awesome. I listen to so much music
with drums, and I never feel it’s limited by those drums whatsoever. If I added
drums I’d just feel like I’m doing some Flying Lotus stuff or whatever. And
he’s real good at what he does, but I don’t think it’s for me necessarily.
AUDIENCE MEMBER
The first time I heard your stuff was that track “Nobody Here” and it was on a
CD-R of about 20 things. It said KGB Man on the front. Will KGB Man ever
reappear? ‘Cause some of it was, not meaning to be rude, but it was kind of
bizarre, like sampling “Castle In The Sky.” Are you over that or is KGB Man
waiting to be resurrected?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
I just want to make a distinction that this was something not meant to be
looked at like my main thing. I think a lot of those eccojams are just cathartic for me and they’re cathartic for people who like them, but also a lot of people really don’t like them (laughs). They’re like, “What the fuck is this bullshit?” I make them when I hear something in pop music, and I’m just like, “Fuck, I just wanna hear that over and over, it’s just the dumbest thing.” If I don’t hear that I won’t make it, but if I do I’ll just fucking loop it, that’s it, put some echo on it. It’s not mine to do.
TODD L. BURNS 
Where does the video for that stuff come from?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
“Nobody Here” was…
TODD L. BURNS 
But just in general, how are you using that?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
I liked the image because, as a corollary to the idea, it matches the sentiment of the
lyric. I’d just moved to New York. This is the same time as that cat lady
shit. I was like like, “What the fuck is it with New York? It’s a horrible place!
Nobody should live here.” It’s a place where there are tons of people, but I never feel connected. So that made sense, like this rainbow bridge, this city, like look at all
this fucking opportunity, it’s all right here. But you never get it. And some
people do. But this is my personal experience, I just like the allegory of
that.
AUDIENCE MEMBER
You said earlier that sometimes you have to lie when you play electronic
music. Do you think electronic music should be played by real musicians and
what do you think the future of electronic music will be like?
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
It shouldn’t be played by anyone specific, and real versus unreal is not relevant
to making something that’s powerful or worthy of being in the world. It’s a
personal thing, I don’t think music needs to be music to be musical, or be
music, if that makes sense. I have personal goals moving forward
that involve upping certain things. I would like to feel a little more
flexible and not feel hinged to my array of ten chords that I fucking use over and
over. There are other things that are technical things I’d like to improve. I
don’t think anyone should ever be intimidated to be more technical or at the same
time, be aloof or above that and just be like, “Well, those are the trained
musicians. I’m an artist.” 
There’s examples of great work everywhere, but it’s
just about utilizing what you need to drive your message home. The toughest
part of music for me… I always think of that Stevie Wonder
record, Music Of My
Mind. That’s an amazing title for a record that’s his first breakout record
when he wasn’t being held down by having to be Stevie Boy Wonder. That’s what
I always think about, the music of my mind – like, how do you translate the thought
to the expression of the music? That’s the difficulty. It has nothing to do
with what you know, it’s just a process to me, it’s just life. You do your best, that’s pretty much it.
TODD L. BURNS 
On that note, thank you very much.
ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER 
Thanks guys. (Applause)

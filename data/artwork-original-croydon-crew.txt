Until the birth of Magnetic Man, Artwork may have been one of the least well-known men in dubstep – his relatively minimal recording output meant his public profile was low, even though he was a legend to the cognoscenti. As Magnetic Man, the man who was once a pivotal figure in Croydon’s celebrated Big Apple shop and label travelled the world with Skream and Benga to a chorus of screaming teenagers. 
In this lecture at the 2011 Red Bull Music Academy, he traces his steps from the dawn of dubstep via the heyday of FWD>> to the collapse in vinyl sales and the new international market for the sound of a drab London suburb (that isn’t really in London anyway).
Torsten Schmidt 
Our very last day of lectures today opens with a young man from the outer boroughs of the greater London area. Please give a very warm welcome to someone who his mum, I presume, knows as Arthur Smith. 
(applause) 
Artwork 
Not so young. 
Torsten Schmidt 
Well, young is pretty relative these days, isn’t it? I mean, if President Carter gets away with calling 30 the new 20 or whatever. 
Artwork
I’ll go with that, yeah. 
Torsten Schmidt 
So, take us to Croydon. 
Artwork 
We had a record shop in Croydon. If people don’t know about Croydon, it was,
well, it wasn’t very trendy, if you know what I mean. Nobody cool was there,
it had a bad kind of reputation. 
Torsten Schmidt 
Bad reputation for what? 
Artwork 
For everything, there’s not a lot going on there. 
Torsten Schmidt 
What’s the size of it? 
Artwork
It’s quite small, it’s not really in London, it’s in Surrey, but they like to call themselves London. I was born there and grew up there, and there wasn’t a lot going on. If you wanted any kind of action you had to go into London. There’s nothing really to do there. 
Torsten Schmidt
How long would it take you to get into, let’s say, Leicester Square? 
Artwork 
Probably take you about an hour. It takes you 20 minutes on the train then
you’ve got to do some tubes and stuff like that. 
Torsten Schmidt 
I guess, it’s a big phenomenon especially in England, but in many other countries around the world, where you have the boys from the ‘burbs or even the proper countryside that really make shit happen, because everyone in the city itself is just so blasé about being in the city. But it’s those kids who
really want to aspire to something and who then start to make things happen. 
Artwork 
Yeah, it was weird. I’ve often been interviewed and people say, “Oh Croydon,
you know, this amazing place, blah, blah, blah.” And it was just because it
wasn’t an amazing place that things happened. I’ve met people in America that
say that they want to come to Croydon to visit the home of dubstep, you know?
(laughs) 
Torsten Schmidt 
What would you do then, take them down to the local chippy? 
Artwork 
Yeah there’s nothing there. There was nothing in Croydon, so don’t go there! But we had the record shop, which was kind of our oasis, the little place where everyone would meet. 
Torsten Schmidt 
So, was that the first specialist record shop there, or were there Our
Price’s and those kinds of things? 
Artwork 
Yeah, there was a shop very early on called My Price in Croydon that had Jazzy M, who was one of the first people to bring house music to England, and it was his shop. That was when I was really, really young and that was the
shop that I would go into and buy acid house records and Chicago records and stuff like that. So there’s always been something in Croydon, even if it’s a tiny little thing, where you could get hold of music and meet people, and Big Apple records was our one. 
Torsten Schmidt 
You’ve spun up a tune there (gestures to decks). How would that relate to
all of that? 
Artwork 
Yeah, this is the first record we put out on our record label Big Apple. The
shop was run by John Kennedy and I had a recording studio above the shop, and
we were making white labels and stuff like that and selling them in the shop.
Then there was the point where we decided that we wanted to make records for our community, for our little group in our shop, and so we decided to make a record label that could only be sold in our shop. It wasn’t going to be sold anywhere else. 
So we pressed up, and this is one I made, our first release on Big Apple. It was kind of weird, we knew we didn’t have to make records to play to a big market because we just wanted to make records for us, for my friends. We knew we were going to make a loss, it wasn’t going to make loads of money. But it didn’t last long because we were doing really well. People came from places around to buy our records, but then we were getting so much
hassle by everyone, that we had to sell them. 
Torsten Schmidt 
What year are we talking about now? 
Artwork 
I don’t know, something like, 2000.
(music: Artwork – “Red”) 
Torsten Schmidt 
So that was released 11 years ago, under which moniker? 
Artwork 
That was under Artwork, it was called “Red.” At the time it was garage music, and it was vocals. There was some darker stuff around but when we first got it pressed up the guy was like, “Well, I’m glad you’re selling it at your shop, because you’re not going to sell many!” (laughs) We made it a red-coloured
vinyl, we really wanted to make it a little bit special and it didn’t sell many when it first came out. 
Torsten Schmidt 
Maybe to put it into a historical context here, would you happen to have any
sort of garage from that era, or somewhere near? 
Artwork 
Yeah, probably. Excuse me. 
Torsten Schmidt 
How do you organize these things? 
Artwork 
I don’t. (flicks through) Some garage… 
(music: unknown)
Torsten Schmidt 
Well, that works as a kind of wake-up call in the morning. 
Artwork 
Yeah, that’s the darker side of garage, the kind of speed garage thing that we were into where we were from, and then there was the 2-step kind of thing at the same time that was happening. But it was all about our shop, and there was a club called FWD>>. We’d just go into that club once a week on Thursdays. 
Torsten Schmidt
FWD>> was at a different venue at the time, right? 
Artwork 
Yeah, FWD>> was at Velvet Rooms, which is gone
now. I went up there and it’s completely gone. We used to go there and there were probably about 50 people in the whole club and 35 of those were producers, people that were making the music, so you’d go there to hear your
records being played. So all of us from the record shop, probably 12, 13 would go up. 
Torsten Schmidt 
What was your favourite mode of transport for going up? 
Artwork 
Well, I was just going to say, that we worked out that if we all got in cabs
that it would cost us like £40 each, so 12 of us would hire a really horrible
limousine from a stretch limousine company and we’d all go up in that. The
rest of the producers thought we were (laughs) trying to be flash, but it
was the cheapest way of getting there. 
Torsten Schmidt 
What was the drink of choice there? 
Artwork 
In the actual limousine? Well, the limousine company were kind enough to put
a bottle of really, really cheap fizzy wine which we used to call “trampagne,”
which was horrible, but it was really big. One night Skream drank the whole
bottle before we got there. (laughs) 
Torsten Schmidt 
So what’s new? 
Artwork
Yeah! 
Torsten Schmidt 
He wasn’t even allowed to drink, right? 
Artwork 
No, I think he was allowed to drink inside the limo because he was with adults. 
Torsten Schmidt
So who was posing as his guide? 
Artwork 
Hatcha, unfortunately. He was also a minor at the time (laughs). 
Torsten Schmidt 
You say “we” an awful lot. Can you perhaps sketch out who these people were? 
Artwork 
We had John Kennedy, Hatcha, who used to work behind [the counter] serving the records, Benga and Skream, Horsepower, Benny Ill, Hijack, who used to run the drum & bass floor. But then the people who used to come to the shop were DMZ, like Mala and Coki, Loefah, DJ Chef was in there, N-Type, Kode9, just so many people at the time who used to hang around in the shop and exchange ideas and come to the studio and make some stuff. It was kind of like a small Red Bull Music Academy. (laughs) 
Torsten Schmidt 
Perhaps with a little more drinking. 
Artwork 
Yeah. 
Torsten Schmidt 
So, one just doesn’t wake up and have a studio above a record store. What
were the circumstances? Because at that time it was a rather privileged
position, to have actual access to a physical recording facility. 
Artwork 
Yes, it was just something I’d done since I left school. I did it the hard
way and went and worked making tea in a recording studio. 
Torsten Schmidt 
What studio was that? 
Artwork 
It was called F.O.R. It’s outside of Croydon and it was tape, and a tiny
little sampler, like 10-second sampling time. I’d have to make the tea, but I had a job at the same time working for my dad making swimming pools, so I’d work in the day and then leave to work in the studio during the night and I’d have about two or three hours sleep. In the end my dad was like, “You’re
sacked.” So I had to go and work in the studio full time. And then I just gathered my own equipment and then John from the record shop was like, “I’ve got a room upstairs, you can put the studio up there.” And it worked out
really well. 
Torsten Schmidt 
Is there anything that was recorded at F.O.R. that the world will know? 
Artwork 
No, definitely not. The best band that I recorded there was a group of guys that worked in a mortuary. They were called Haram Scarum and I recorded them, and to practise, they used to prop the bodies up so that they could have an audience.
(laughter) 
Torsten Schmidt 
Right, so I take it they were doing uplifting music? 
Artwork 
No, a little bit different. 
Torsten Schmidt
When you were saying you were doing that all the time, I somehow have the
feeling that there was a little bit of a gap between then and 2000. Was there
anything you’d like to share that you’d been recording beforehand? 
Artwork 
Yeah, before then I was making techno music and it was weird, it was crossing
over, I was really into techno stuff. 
Torsten Schmidt 
When you say techno, what do you mean? Coming from a land where techno can mean a lot of different things... 
Artwork 
Oh yeah, I was making stuff under the name Grain for FatCat. 
Torsten Schmidt 
Another seminal record shop. 
Artwork 
Yeah, I had the second release on the FatCat label. 
Torsten Schmidt 
How did you get in touch with those boys then? 
Artwork 
Because it was two record shops. They were coming into our record shop and we were going into theirs, and because they knew we had our own recording studio. John knew Alex Knight,
the guy who ran FatCat, and they just approached me and said, “Do you want to
put some of this stuff out?” I can play you some if you want. 
Torsten Schmidt
Yeah, that would be great. 
Artwork 
I got this ready, I know where this is. Same stuff, just different. I have to
find the right one. It was that kind of stuff. 
(music: Grain – untitled / applause) 
Torsten Schmidt 
Mildly bigger rooms there. Did you have any other techno monikers? 
Artwork 
No! (laughs)
Torsten Schmidt
And what are the secret ones that you don’t want to tell us about? 
Artwork 
There’s many, quite a few different ones. I swore I’d never tell anyone, so… 
Torsten Schmidt 
Do you want to whisper any in my ear? 
Artwork 
No! (laughs) 
Torsten Schmidt 
You know, there are incredibly credible people in this building who you find on Top Of The Pops and stuff, with early stuff they’ve done, so you know, you’d be in good company. In the
UK especially, and in Germany quite a lot, too, they have the same sort of
thing that they did, trying out various monikers and things. Sometime things
that they might not be telling their mum about. I mean, production-wise. 
Artwork 
Yeah, I mean at one point when we were doing the garage stuff, we realised that we’re pressing up these records and we were getting one out every week, every two weeks. So at one point in the record shop, we had one of the walls that was all the stuff that I was either doing by myself or I was doing with
other people. 
And it was under the same sort of name, so we thought, “We’re going to have to start coming up with different names.” So we made up about
five or six different names, and then we had the whole wall. But then people were coming in and saying, “Oh, I like that, I don’t like these lot, I like them.” (laughs) It was the one way we could get a lot of records out, to
make different names up. 
Torsten Schmidt
That was pretty good for your acting skills as well, right? 
Artwork 
Yeah, of course. 
Torsten Schmidt 
You know, “No them lot, I don’t like them.” 
Artwork 
“Yeah, they’re rubbish.” I think we started beef between two of the people at
one point as well. (laughs) 
Torsten Schmidt 
Oh, so DOOM got
that idea from you then. 
Artwork 
Yeah. 
Torsten Schmidt 
Yeah, I get it. There’s something very striking for people who were not from
the UK, this whole ‘over the counter’ culture. That you had someone behind the
counter serving you records who was just going, “Play them,” and then just put
them away. It wasn’t in a way where you could go and dig for yourself. 
Artwork 
Yeah, we had the shop downstairs where Hatcha was a genius at picking up a record, turning it up full volume, and then just looking you in the face until you buy it. And then you’d get people who’d get home and be like, “God, what have I got here?” You know, but that works. But then we set up the listening booth so you could go upstairs and there were five or six chairs you could sit in and you could take your records up and make your own mind up, and you’d end up with stuff you actually wanted. 
Torsten Schmidt 
How much did sales decline after that? 
Artwork 
No, it was good! They were really, really good. It was a great idea, so
people could have a listen to their own stuff and you’d have your favorite
booth. You know, you’d have the one that had the needle that worked properly
and the headphones that weren’t broken. 
Torsten Schmidt 
Were there any other sort of connections outside the shop of how everyone got
in there, or was it a ‘walking down the road’-kind of vibe, and ‘what’s going
on here?’-sort of thing? 
Artwork 
It was a place where, if you were into music you’d just go to this place because from 12 o’clock to 1 o’clock, in the day till about 7 to 8 at night, it would just be people hanging out. The same sort of people who were making
music usually would turn up at some point to bring a CD that they’d made at home to test it out on the system to see what people thought about it. 
Then you’d be standing next to another producer and they’d be like, “How’d you make that bassline?” And you’d be like, “Oh, I did it like this,” and you’d end up making tracks together. And you learn so fast in that kind of environment. I don’t think you get it the same with the online world, record shops are gone. They used to be a place where if you were really into music you’d go there just to listen to music all day. But then that kind of learning curve happens really fast for producers and people who were making music as well, because you’re surrounded by the same sort of people. 
Torsten Schmidt 
But at the same time, especially if you’re a newbie in that scenario, it can
be incredibly intimidating in that setting. 
Artwork 
I don’t think it was there. If you had something to play, we were really into
playing it and listening to it. The whole kind of scene, the dubstep scene and
that FWD>> sort of vibe was, “Yeah, bring stuff along, if it’s good it’s gonna get played.” It was very open, not closed shop at all. 
Torsten Schmidt
But at the same time, it’s human nature and especially amongst males, that
there’s a strong element of one-upmanship. 
Artwork 
I don’t think it was, we were gentlemen about it. (laughs) But yeah, you always wanted to make the best kind of track you could and bring it in. You’ve got a shop full of other producers and you’ve still got to bring your track down and say, “Can I put this on?” And you’ve got that moment when you put it
on and you’re standing there looking around. But because it was a record shop, the good thing about it was that if you brought your record down and said, “Hey can you play this?” - and put it on, usually if there was a record shop full of people, you’d get people saying, “I’ll have one of those.” And that
was it. You knew it was cool. 
Torsten Schmidt 
It’s like an instant litmus test. You maybe want to play something else? 
Artwork 
Yeah. 
Torsten Schmidt
Is this chronologically? 
Artwork 
Yeah, I sort of did it like that. This is a remix I did very early on. This
is probably going back to the garage kind of stuff again, sort of showing
where it was blending over. This is quite early on. 
Torsten Schmidt
And what is this? 
Artwork 
This is a bootleg we did, one of the early bootlegs we did. 
(music: Artwork – unknown / applause)
(music: Menta – “Sounds Of Da Future” / applause) 
Torsten Schmidt 
You could already tell now, looking back that at the time, it kind of stood out, especially compared to a lot of the R&B a capella kind of stuff, because there’s definitely a lot of textural kind of stuff going on there. 
Artwork
Yeah, and it was good. It was that club FWD>>, it was being able to have that stuff played, and that was our little world, we didn’t care about where else it was getting played. You would make a record just to get played at your
club or you’d make a record for your friends. So you weren’t worried that it wasn’t getting played up and down the country because we were mainly just going to that club, that was our world. 
Torsten Schmidt 
At the same time, there was this connection between FWD>> and Rinse, and so on and so on. Can you recall going to Rinse for the first time? 
Artwork 
Yeah, I think I went up with Hatcha. It was a pirate radio station but it’s done pretty well now, it’s quite a nice studio. It was strange. You had Sarah, who was running FWD>> and Rinse, and we were doing stuff under the name of
Menta with Danny Harrison, which we were putting out on Road, which was a label she was
running as well. So she was very, very important. Her and Geeneus were very important in the start of dubstep and how it worked, because without that club and without the radio station we would still just be a little record shop with some geezers
hanging around in it. 
Torsten Schmidt 
I guess her day job must have helped, because she always had her ear to the ground and stuff. Can you elaborate a little on that, because that’s a really unique setting? A very strong woman and a person who probably doesn’t get enough credit. 
Artwork
She doesn’t get enough credit. She was working for EMI at the time, so she had big
connections and she could get big people like vocalists. And people would listen to her. For me, if you’re looking at the history of how dubstep has got to where it has, that’s a key player, Sarah Lockhart. Without her, none of
this would be here. 
Torsten Schmidt 
You said about the Menta stuff. Who was that? 
Artwork
Me and Danny Harrison. 
Torsten Schmidt
You talk about Danny Harrison quite a lot. 
Artwork
Yeah, he’s very important, we did all the Menta stuff, and the Sounds Of Da
Future stuff, and we did loads of different remixes and bootlegs and countless
stuff together. He was a very important guy at the shop as well, and he’s
still in everyone’s mind the funniest guy in the shop. Yeah, good guy. 
Torsten Schmidt
On the bootleg front, I guess things are gone long enough that’s its probably safe to talk about them now. Any bootlegs that you recommend looking out for? 
Artwork 
I don’t know. Unfortunately, my memory’s not that great.
Torsten Schmidt 
It happens. Comes with the bootleg territory. Would you happen to have any stuff on there? 
Artwork 
Of the bootleg stuff? Not really. Setting up and getting ready for this, I didn’t quite know the sort of stuff I should bring. I suppose the next kind of thing I should play is when FWD>> early on started to get there, as Hatcha was the main DJ there, and he was asking people to make darker records.
If you were making records for him, he’d say, “Oh, I want more bass, blah, blah.” So he’s quite instrumental in how that sound changed, because it was like, breakier stuff and the Sounds Of Da Future stuff, and there were Zed
Bias records being played, and El-B records being played. 
Torsten Schmidt 
And they were both not from south London. 
Artwork 
Well, Zed Bias is from, well, not from south London. El-B is from south London, he used to come in the shop as well. Hatcha was phoning people up and asking them, “Could you make me this? But I’d like that, and I want this a bit
more dark and a bit nasty,” and stuff like that. 
Torsten Schmidt
So he was basically acting as a very serious
A&R / curator person for that
particular scene? 
Artwork 
Absolutely. And what he was playing then would filter out because people would be making stuff for him, and then people would be copying the styles that he was playing as well. And this was the kind of point when it went dark. This is a track I made called “The Soul.” This is early Artwork this is just after “Red.”
(music: Artwork - “The Soul”)
Torsten Schmidt 
When Hatcha phoned you up and said, “I need more bass on this, and it needs
to go more in this direction and that direction,” you’re talking about a time
when you could not go onto YouTube and go like, “Oh, OK, how am I gonna do
that sort of bass?” or whatever. 
Artwork 
Yeah, this is pre-internet, we didn’t have the internet in the record shop. That’s sort of why it stayed in its little place for quite so long, because there was no internet. 
Torsten Schmidt 
So who did you specifically learn from about bass treatments? 
Artwork 
We had drum & bass to listen to, and we had a lot of the stuff from garage to listen to, but it was all about going into the studio and sitting down and thinking, “How do I do this?” - and messing about until you got the
sound. But the lucky thing was that you got studio monitors but you also had a record shop downstairs that had speakers bigger than this (gestures to speakers), so it was great because you could just walk downstairs, plug it down, or bring your tracks and think, “Oh, it’s not quite working, I need more
bottom end.” Or, “I need this on the snare.” So that’s why it was good to have
the record shop again, to test stuff out. 
Torsten Schmidt 
What was your favourite weapon of choice? 
Artwork 
For bass? At that time I had a Nord Lead
3 and I was just so into it at
the time because it had that kind of weight, but I would always go back to
taking the bottom end off it and putting just a subtone from the Akai
S-3000. It was weird, nowadays
you can go and ask someone, “How do you do that?” Back then we didn’t really
have it, we were just going off each other and what we were doing. 
Torsten Schmidt
The S-3000 already had a visual at this point, right?
Artwork
It did, yeah, I think, when I started off, the first one we had up there was a S-950, which didn’t, it just had little strips, but the S-3000 was well advanced. I think I paid about
£2,800 and it’s worth about five quid now, quite annoying. 
Torsten Schmidt 
That was a lot of swimming pools. 
Artwork 
Yeah (laughs), or bootlegs. 
Torsten Schmidt 
Or that. Does this bootleg thing still make any economic sense nowadays? 
Artwork 
I don’t think so. Back then it was like, you kind of had to buy it on vinyl, you couldn’t get an MP3, so if you wanted a record you had to walk into a record shop and pay your money and get a piece of vinyl. It was good times. 
Torsten Schmidt 
Was there anything that you learned from that process that you can still apply these days in a totally different environment? 
Artwork 
I don’t know, it’s completely changed now. I don’t know how to make money out of music anymore. It’s a weird kind of set-up. It’s completely different to how we started. When we started you had control because you could make a piece on vinyl and sell it and that was the only way you could do it. I remember CD
copying coming in and then MP3s, and that was it, nobody bought anything anymore, so it’s completely changed now. 
Torsten Schmidt 
If you were to draw a graph of sales of your releases, how would that pan out
over the years? 
Artwork 
For vinyl? 
Torsten Schmidt 
No, just in general. 
Artwork 
Oh, in general, I don’t know. People are telling me now that out of people
that buy this kind of music, only 20% of them actually pay for it, which is
freaky, so I don’t know. It’s got itself in a mess, I don’t know how to get
out of it, I don’t have the answers. 
Torsten Schmidt 
How many times a week do you play out then? 
Artwork 
DJing? Last week, four or five or something like that, some weeks twice. 
Torsten Schmidt 
Those four or five were stretched out over how many days? 
Artwork 
Er, five days. 
Torsten Schmidt 
OK, so you’re not doing those crazy sessions. 
Artwork 
No, there were two in one night but I try to keep it one a night. 
Torsten Schmidt 
I don’t know whether we should just jump start to the current situation or
whether you want to take us in more of a chronological order, it’s up to you. 
Artwork 
Yeah, we were making that kind of music, and I guess the next thing that came
along was that we signed Digital Mystikz, which kind of took it to an even darker kind of place. At the time, no one had heard anything like this, they were out there on their own. I’ll play some. This is “Da Wrath,” we signed
this to Big Apple.
(music: Digital Mystikz – “Da Wrath” / applause) 
At that point there was nothing else like that. When they came in the shop and we said, “Look, we want to sign some stuff,” that they were doing, they delivered that and there was nothing else like it at all, which was great for the label, it was great for us and what we were doing. It set a new benchmark
for people. People could do exactly what they wanted. You could do something completely freaked out and people were interested in it. 
This was about the time when we started to sell vinyl on the internet around the world, so you’d have people from Japan who were buying records from us mail order and getting
the record mailed to them. So this was around the time when we just started to do that. So that’s the next step. 
Torsten Schmidt 
It’s interesting because it’s still pretty hard but at the same time you can
have a hint of that dub element in there. 
Artwork 
I think just going back a little bit, everyone says, “Where does dubstep come from?” And one thing that always gets missed out is the Horsepower stuff, Benny Ill and Horsepower. Benny Ill used to come into my studio and he was making techno kind of stuff, and we were making garage, and he would say, “I
want to make some of this garage.” 
And he’d go away for two or three weeks and he’d come back and he’d have what he thought was garage. The beats were all on the wrong beats, the snare was all on the wrong thing, and he had dub samples from old dub records. And everyone was a bit like, “This is weird, this is not like the normal garage stuff.” But Hatcha loved it and Hatcha was playing it.
It was like 2-step but it wasn’t, it had too much dub in it. So that whole very dubby sound and that 2-step thing, he’s got to have a lot of credit for it. 
Torsten Schmidt 
For years, there was some kind of riddle because if you were living a little bit further away from Big Apple records, you had no context for it. But once in a while you’d get one of these records and you’re like, “I have no fucking clue what this is supposed to be, but it’s got about every influence I like on the planet in there. It doesn’t really make sense but I like it.” 
Artwork 
Yeah, and that was the thing, that was what we were into. It was just about making records for your mates. It was about making records. 
Torsten Schmidt
Yes, but at the same time, you have all these other people who were growing up with kind of similar influences very far away, places like Germany and Japan, which were kind of connected to it. 
Artwork 
Yeah, totally. 
Torsten Schmidt 
And they were probably just drawn into it by the purity of it. This is probably a good time to play some Horsepower. 
Artwork 
I don’t think I have any in this bag, sorry. 
Torsten Schmidt 
OK, no worries. For the YouTube folks out there, what Horsepower tunes do you
recommend to go for? 
Artwork 
You can pick any of them. I mean, all of them are so good and they’re so well crafted. I’ve been sitting behind Benny Ill in the studio and watching him work and he’s a guy that will sit and EQ a hi-hat for an hour. It’s amazing to watch. So any of it, and that’s one thing I can say, if you listen to any of the Horsepower tracks, they’re all good. So just put in ‘Horsepower’ and pick any ‘cause they’re all good. 
Torsten Schmidt
Did Mala and that lot have their party already when they put that out? 
Artwork 
I don’t think they’d done one yet. But obviously that’s another step that came
on when they started doing DMZ in Brixton, which was even closer. We didn’t even have to get a limousine for that one. (laughs)
It was really close to the shop, they started that party and it was amazing. It was a very good party and you could go and listen to great music just up the road. 
Torsten Schmidt 
The interesting thing, I guess, is that if you compare FWD>> to DMZ, FWD>> is still very much about going there more from a producer’s angle, and DMZ is a proper dance, like borderline raves. 
Artwork 
Yeah, I love it. Every time I’ve been to DMZ it’s been amazing. They got a lot more people in there, the producers are still there, but they kind of get lost. 
Torsten Schmidt
Anything else you want to play or share with us? 
Artwork
I’ll try and think of something. From that kind of era? 
Torsten Schmidt 
I guess, we can gradually move on. 
Artwork 
Yeah, let’s just go through this. This is a track from Coki who was signed to Big Apple, and this was Coki just moving it on. He’s one of my heroes. His stuff is just mad. I think this is one of the later Big Apple releases, I
think it’s probably one of the last ones we did.
(music: Coki – “Red Eye” / applause) 
Torsten Schmidt 
Do you know whether he was working in construction before as well, because
he’s always so good with using space? 
Artwork 
He’s just unbelievable. You think he’s reached a point where that’s mental and you can’t go any further than that, and he keeps doing it. He keeps coming out with something just as good. He’s always been a constant. For me, Coki tracks are something that I’ll listen to and think, “God, how has he done that?” He’s amazing, he’s really cool. 
Torsten Schmidt
Rumour has it that Hatcha is not the only person in your family that has
anything to do with music... 
Artwork
How do you mean? 
Torsten Schmidt 
There may be others from the same camp that are doing music, and I believe you might know one of the people quite well. 
Artwork
Who? I don’t understand the question. 
Torsten Schmidt
Don’t worry. OK, there’s a bunch of teenagers, who are a little bit younger
than you that one day kind of got into the shop. 
Artwork 
Yeah, Benga and Skream. So, they basically used to come into the shop and buy records, and they would bring their tracks in on MP3 players when they started making tracks. They’d keep bringing them back and keep bringing them back until at one point we were like, “This is actually getting really good now.” 
So we signed Benga when he was 16 years old. It was for the second Big Apple
release. I did the first one, he did the second one. To watch them go from the
start and start making records... we put out about three or four of their records out as releases and what they’ve done is amazing. 
Torsten Schmidt 
How many years were they coming into the shop before you were like, “Yeah,
this is the level now?” 
Artwork 
I don’t know, I remember Oliver coming
in with his school uniform on, so they must have been about 14. They came in for about two years before they were even making any tracks. They were really cool, really nice kids that just wanted to be into the music. You could see that they were really, really into it. 
Then, when we signed them, I think it
was good for them to put their release out on our record label because we were putting out anything that was good, we didn’t really care about, “Oh it doesn’t have this, it doesn’t have that.” That was just what our label was
about, so I think it was a good place for them to start. 
Torsten Schmidt
How long were you managing the label? 
Artwork
Between the three of us, it was sort of like, six years or something like that. 
Torsten Schmidt 
Do you have some of those old Oliver and Benga tunes on you? 
Artwork 
Yeah I do, this is one of my favourite ones actually. This is Benga and “Skank.”
(music: Benga – “Skank” / applause) 
Shall we play a Skream one from back then? 
(music: Skream – unknown) 
Torsten Schmidt
Was that still on Playstation vibes? 
Artwork 
No, that would have been made on FL
Studio, because they started making the beats on Playstation, which were good. Then they started making them on FLStudio and they got better and better and better, and then they were bringing stuff in. I mean, I had a studio upstairs which probably cost me about 25 grand, and they had a computer at home which probably cost them about 200 quid – and they were bringing stuff in and I was thinking, “Shit, how the fuck did they make that?” (laughs) It was sounding great. That was the reason we signed them up. 
Torsten Schmidt 
So you basically wanted to steal their trade secrets? 
Artwork 
(laughs) No, it was great, it was good to see them making music on such
basic equipment and it kind of showed us that they had a real feel for it, and
they weren’t really interested in the arms race, they just had their equipment
and they knew it. 
Torsten Schmidt 
That was a definite shift because just a few years before that you could
literally tell, especially in drum & bass, when there was a new piece of
technology released. All of a sudden, with the S-3000, you could definitely
tell, “Shit they’ve got something new.” Because all of a sudden the filters
would sound different or whatever, but then, and all of a sudden, it was like,
“We don’t care.” 
Artwork 
Yeah, when we were making the tracks, like when I was making “Red,” they were
at 135 BPM, and by the time they were bringing these in, they were 140. I did
ask Oliver, I was like, “This is like five BPM faster.” And apparently, when
you switch on FL studio, 140 is the default setting, so that’s why most of the
tracks were 140. (laughs) 
Torsten Schmidt 
And then America got involved… 
Artwork
Yeah. 
Torsten Schmidt 
OK, can you tell me what happened in between the time of you signing them up?
I mean, obviously this is a long stretch of time to cover here, but from that,
up until the time you realised that maybe you could do something together as a
project. 
Artwork 
Yeah. We got to a point with Big Apple where we were selling vinyl and then
the shop’s vinyl sales just stopped. MP3s came along, and no one was buying
the vinyl. And we weren’t really geared up for selling in that world. Sarah
approached us and said, “Look, I want to put some stuff of Oliver’s and Ben’s
out – I know they’re signed to you, but we want to put them out.” And we just
said, “Yeah, that’s a much better idea for them.” 
So then Oliver put an album
out and Benga put an album out, and it was a great move for them. Again, Sarah
was so well set up, she knew what she was doing, and she could take them to
the next level. It was around that sort of time that we started talking about
making some stuff together – we made some early stuff which I don’t have with
me, sorry, you’ll have to have a look on the internet for early Magnetic Man
stuff. 
But we had an idea that we would make these tracks together, that we could play out live. DJing at the time was on vinyl; it was on dubplates and it could only go so far, but there was new technology coming out like
Ableton, which was kind of interesting in that you could split tracks up, and you could do things live
and take it to another level. If you look at these tracks, the elements are
drums, bass and a top line, and we thought, “Well, if each person was
controlling each part, you could do the tracks live and mix them into other
tracks and stuff.” 
So it was sort of an idea we started out with, and we made four or five tracks and started to piece it together. We did a half-hour show
at FWD>> but we didn’t want anyone to know that it was us that was doing it. 
Torsten Schmidt 
Which was kind of hard when you have 50 people in there, and some might have
to go to the back. 
Artwork
No, it was cool, because they were so many people in there, and the people
that knew, knew, but it was blocked off. We put a white sheet up and we put a
strobe light behind us and played this set. People were kind of pissed off
that we were trying to hide, they were like, “Who is this bloke, this Magnetic
Man fellow?” They liked the records, and that’s all we wanted. We just wanted
to make some new music that was a little bit different, and see if people
liked it for what it was, rather than, “This is something that Benga, Skream
and Artwork have done.” We wanted to see if people liked it for what it was,
and it kind of went down alright. Then, we had a friend of ours, N-Type, who
has a radio show, and he played one of the records and then bigged us up at
the same time, so that was that. 
Torsten Schmidt 
But it’s probably worth noting that at the time, people from outside were
probably like, “Who is this Artwork fellow?” And at the same time, if you
asked Oliver and Benga they were like, “Oh no, he’s a real man and we always
looked up to him.” It’s always really interesting to see how you’ve got this
intrinsic perspective from your actual social surroundings. 
Artwork 
That was part of the reason we wanted to keep it anonymous, and it would have
been great if we did, but it didn’t last that long. It’s difficult to do that
nowadays. 
Torsten Schmidt 
But weirdly enough, like at Coachella for example, they run this thing where they
ask what people want to see, and to put in their favourite five acts that they
really want to see in there, so they can put it into their customised
timetable. And they ran this experiment with Magnetic Man, and it ranked a lot
lower than when they changed it to “Skream and Benga,” because people are
like, “Oh yeah, we know that one.” 
Artwork 
Yeah. I don’t know, it’s weird that’s how it went. We just wanted to do
something new, something that was disassociated. Something that was completely
different so that it left the two things separate. 
Torsten Schmidt 
And to a degree, all of a sudden you are entering a territory where Magnetic
Man is confronted with a whole different crowd that kind of goes beyond
FWD>>.
Artwork 
Yeah, completely. We’re doing festivals now that are like, 40,000 people, so
it’s totally different from where we started. We just want to push something
as far as it can go. And it does go back to that thing when you’re at
FWD>> and there’s 50 people there, all you want is 100 people, and when
you get 100, all you want is 1,000. You keep pushing that kind of thing. It’s
a different vibe you get at a festival, you’re playing to new people who would
have never listened to your music before, they’ve just gone along to listen to
music and if they come and find you and they like it, it’s good. 
Torsten Schmidt 
One of the most exciting times in those sort of developments is when the
first one, two, three singles happen and all the craziness that goes when
things start to accelerate really very quickly. Can you take us a little bit
through that time? 
Artwork 
Yeah, it was weird. We’d been touring Magnetic Man for three years as a show
and it started off with a tiny little box, which was the sound of a puppet box
with a projection in the back of it and then it moved on and we were doing
quite big stage shows. Then a record company approached us after we’d won at
Roskilde. We’d played to
about 15,000 people, and put the video on YouTube and they approached us and
said, “What’s going on, what is this, who are you?” And they didn’t really
know about the music, it still was quite underground, that dubstep sound. No
one had been signed to a major record label so they came to us and said, “Do
you want to sign with us?” It was a weird time because you have to look at it
and think, “What are we going to get out of this?” I think the good thing was
that we wanted the exposure, we wanted to get to as many people as we could,
and signing to a record label like Sony, well, you’re going to do that. 
Torsten Schmidt 
So the first releases were on Tempa? 
Artwork 
Well, they were on Magnetic Man, it was like its own little label. 
Torsten Schmidt 
But Tempa mailed them out. 
Artwork 
Yes. 
Torsten Schmidt 
Can you show us one from that time? 
Artwork 
I haven’t got any of them with me, I didn’t get the memo! But yeah, you can
have a look, check the YouTube, check the early ones like
“Eclipse” and”Cyberman” and things like that.
They were the tracks that we were making at that time. 
Torsten Schmidt 
Was that the time that Laurie was working at Tempa? 
Artwork 
Yes. 
Torsten Schmidt 
Which is another crazy thing, you have someone who has their own nice little
entity, which is really key, and probably you can elaborate on that. 
Artwork 
He’s a dude. (laughs) That’s all you need to know! 
Torsten Schmidt 
He does Apple Pips and all that, but he was also really busy. He was really,
“These people need to know about that music,” and just mailing them out to
different people and all that. 
Artwork 
Yeah, he was a big player because he was actually in everyone’s face, really
pushing it. But all those people were, everyone to do with Rinse and
FWD>> all those people, they were all really passionate about it, and I
think that’s what you need to be. 
Torsten Schmidt 
You did bring some Magnetic Man stuff? 
Artwork 
Yeah, this is one thing, the record company came to us and said, “Do what
you’re doing, make whatever you want to make, because you’re doing alright.”
And you could tell some people were thinking that you had to go away and make
some really poppy dubstep, or whatever. But we didn’t care, we went away to
Cornwall and we sat down there for two months, went mental and made the three
singles down there in the first week. 
The rest of the time we were just
messing around until we came back and then we made some progress when we got
back to what we knew. At the same time, we had free rein from the record
company, so we thought, “Well let’s see how much free rein we’ve got.” So we
made this, which is the opening track of the record, because there was so much
expectation from what people thought they were going to get from this, that we
thought that we can see how far away we can go from it. Music’s music, we just
thought we’d make this.
(music: Magnetic Man – “Flying into Tokyo”) 
We wanted to spend some money, so it was like, “Can we have an orchestra?”
“Yes, you can.” “Can we go into a massive studio and record?” “Yes, you can.” 
Torsten Schmidt 
But you did read the bit about all those things being recoupable and stuff? 
Artwork 
Not yet, no, we’re starting to understand that now. (laughs) 
Torsten Schmidt 
So how much did that set you back then? 
Artwork 
That was quite expensive, but it didn’t matter at the time. When you get someone that says, “You can make whatever you want, you can do whatever you want,” you go for it, you just do it. You just take it and go and make it. 
Torsten Schmidt 
And here’s the bit where in the ‘80s a lot of bands go bankrupt. 
Artwork 
Yeah. But no, it wasn’t greatly expensive, it’s just nice to be able to go
and do something like that. 
Torsten Schmidt
Did you have any help with the strings? 
Artwork 
Yeah, Sam Frank did some of the
string arrangement. He’s just amazing. He helped us out with bits and pieces
on the album, and he wrote the lyrics to “The
Bug,” and two or three tracks on
the album. He’s great, he’s a super talented guy, and he’s doing his own stuff
now, so watch out for him. 
Torsten Schmidt 
You said that’s the opener. In the sequence of the album, what would be the
next thing? 
Artwork 
I think it was “Fire,” wasn’t it? I don’t have what was next, but I can play
you this, this is something we did with Ms Dynamite for the album.
(music: Magnetic Man – “Fire”) 
Torsten Schmidt 
You were talking about those expectations and you were signed because of your
live performance. How much did you take the actual live possibilities into
account when producing these tracks? 
Artwork 
When you’re making them you do realise that you’re thinking, “This will be
great, because those drums, etc.” The more simple you can keep it, the better
it is for the live show. You’ve got so much more possibility to change it to
another drum, you can filter it, and it works a lot better live and we’re
still learning with the live stuff, every performance you do is another
rehearsal for us. You suddenly learn something and you do it and someone is
like, “Oh, that’s good,” and we’ll do that again, but it doesn’t happen the
next time, but it might the time after that. It’s interesting because then
when we go to make the next album, you’ve learnt so much more from doing the
live stuff that you can put that back into making a new album. 
Torsten Schmidt 
Obviously, there were a couple of singles on there that crossed over to pop
chart territory and I take it that you’d then get booked to totally different
environments. The promoter can put ‘Magnetic Man’ on there and be like, “Hey,
they’re in the charts, I’m gonna have a full night.” And then you show up at
the club and they’re like, “Fucking hell, what did I get myself into here?” 
Artwork 
Yeah, that can happen but it’s not as bad as it would have been years and
years ago, because people have got so much access, they’re not as silly as
they used to be. Those clubs that you’re talking about would not have had a
clue because they wouldn’t have access to that music to go and listen to it,
and they wouldn’t have gone to the clubs and stuff like that. But now, anyone
can just go onto the internet, you can be as up to date as someone right in
the scene going to all the clubs and stuff, because you just watch it on
YouTube. I think people know a lot more now, they’re a lot more clued up than
they would have been 10 years ago. 
Torsten Schmidt 
Does that increase the pressure of coming with special versions, special
weapons? 
Artwork 
Yeah, luckily we’ve got access to all these vocals so you can put vocals over
something else. It’s good, you get a good reaction when people think they’re
going to hear a record that’s been going for a long time. 
Torsten Schmidt 
Let’s say you’re Mick Jagger and
you’re like, “Oh gosh, I got to play this tune again.” What do you do to keep
yourself entertained while you’re like, “Oh, they want to hear ‘I Need Air’
again,” but you want to keep yourself entertained at the same time? 
Artwork 
The thing is, you can be playing a DJ set and you know at any point you can
echo out and put “I Need Air” on, and it’s great, you can’t knock it because
it still goes off, people still go mad for it, and it doesn’t matter where it
is, it’s still one of those records that goes off anywhere. And you’ll never
get bored of that I think, to play that record and to get that reaction, it’s
still a great buzz. 
Torsten Schmidt
It’s that great buzz that we should generate when people get ready for their
own questions now, so think of your question before you get a buzz.
(music: Magnetic Man – “I Need Air”)
What do you reckon people in 2002 would have said in Big Apple if you played
them this? 
Artwork 
I don’t know, it’s a completely different time. This fitted this time, that
music then fitted that time. It’s different, you know? 
Torsten Schmidt 
There’s a couple of sounds in there that in a lot of environments like Big
Apple 10 years ago would have been the enemy, you would have been shot
straight away. 
Artwork
I don’t think so, because all of us in that shop were into so many different
kinds of music. It was a shop that did actually sell techno and house and drum
& bass and everything. So, it’s like that old thing – there’s only two
types of music, good and bad. 
Torsten Schmidt 
Do you think people are getting chilled out enough to actually admit to
secret penchants for trance now? 
Artwork 
I don’t know. I listen to so many different types of music, and you know, I
like good trance, I like good drum & bass, house, I like everything. I’m
into all sorts of styles and if it comes together to make something new, or something different, I’m up for it. 
Torsten Schmidt 
This track in particular works really well live. Where did you take your cues from as far as the live show goes, like how to set it up? And what other live
shows do you really like? 
Artwork 
How we went about setting this one up, was that basically, we knew we had to
get three sets of Ableton running so that we could have the two sounds going
at the same time. And when we first started it we rigged them together and we
realised that after 21 minutes at 140 BPM, it would fall apart. 
So when we first did the show we had one master computer running two slaves, and that
would run for 21 minutes and fall over. So we’d have to do 19 minutes, stop,
and everybody quickly load up the next patch, the next block, give the nod, and then we could carry on. We’d do that three times in an hour and we got away with it for quite a while. But now, we’ve got something a bit more sophisticated so we can actually run the whole hour. And we can stop it, start
it, go backwards, go forwards, or wherever we want. 
Torsten Schmidt 
Looking back it makes a lot of sense, but as far as live shows go, I’m quite
surprised at how well rated something like a
Modeselektor show was, especially in
your kind of surrounding. 
Artwork 
Yeah, that’s a wicked show, that’s an amazing show. I’ve seen them two or
three times now. 
Torsten Schmidt 
Or the Moderat show, probably even
better. 
Artwork 
Actually, we saw them last year, that was a great show. What we tried to do,
the main thing was, because it’s kind of stripped down, the main tracks are a
lot more basic. If there was one sound, we wanted to shape something for that
sound specifically in design. So we’d sit down with people, come up with that,
so when that sound hits, you get a visual for it. And we’ve kind of got that
now. It was a long time getting there because we had the visuals running live
with a guy at one point. But now, the visuals are all completely when a sound
has got its own MIDI signal to set off
each separate part. So we’re getting to where we want to get with how it
looks, but then you always see something and you think, “Ah, look at that.”
(laughs) I think everyone does. 
Torsten Schmidt 
You’re using quite a lot of different vocalists in the project. To what
degree do you think having the actual physical vocalist there alters the show? 
Artwork
It does. Definitely. We play the Katy B
record as our last track in the set, and it’s great and it goes off, but when
she’s there, it’s absolutely amazing. And the same with Ms
Dynamite, and with P
Money. When we’re playing it does make
a big difference. 
Torsten Schmidt 
Can we play the Katy one? Especially, as she was part of this little shindig
last year. 
Artwork 
Yeah, this is “Perfect Stranger.”
Torsten Schmidt 
Big up, Katy.
(music: Magnetic Man – “Perfect Stranger” / applause)
Is there a question by any chance? 
Audience member
Hello. Obviously, when we hear the last two songs of the Magnetic Man project,
I feel like it’s more of a project for younger people, for kids. For you, is
it important to touch the kids and why? 
Artwork 
I’m not into touching kids, no. I’ll just say that from the off.
(laughter) 
Torsten Schmidt 
And just for the record, you’re talking from a 63-year-old perspective. (laughs) What is your age? 
Audience member
I’m 23. I don’t know, I feel like it’s the kind of music, for example, when I
go to the UK and I see the show for the younger children, that is the kind of
scene and sound they use. And I think that the young generation is more
sensitive because they are less critical about what they listen to. 
Artwork 
Yeah, I’m not sure what you’re getting at, but we just make music that we
like to make, and if kids like it, great; if adults like it, great. We don’t
care, we just make our music. 
Audience member
OK. 
Audience member
How do you guys collaborate? Because I’m assuming you use your laptops, so
what’s your approach? 
Artwork 
On stage? 
Audience member
Yeah, well, how do you write the tracks in the first place? 
Artwork 
When we wrote this album, we hired a mansion in the countryside, stupidly.
Again, we thought the record company had all the money in the world, so we
thought, “Let’s hire a mansion, we’re a band now.” We went down there and we
did the first three singles there in the first week, and then the other six
weeks we were there, we just went mental because it wasn’t like how we’d
usually do stuff. Usually, someone will send something [to someone] who’ll
send it to the other person. Maybe two people are in a room who’ll send it to
another person, then we’d get a backing track together, then the studio with a
singer or a songwriter and move it on, and pass it on to someone else to get
it mixed. And that’s just how it gets done, that’s how we’ve done most of it.
We tried to do it the old fashioned way and we went a bit mad. 
Torsten Schmidt 
So you had a proper Spinal
Tap rock & roll moment? 
Artwork 
Yeah, it was. It was a bit weird down there. (laughs) 
Torsten Schmidt 
But wasn’t part of the idea to get everyone out of London to finally get shit
done? 
Artwork 
It was, it worked for about a week, but there’s nothing to do down there. It
was Cornwall in the off-season so it was just a bit Groundhog
Day, a bit strange. 
Audience member 
Maybe some people here don’t know how huge you are, you were at Buckingham
Palace and you had Prince Harry and William bigging you up. You went from
“trampagne” to this, and I’m just wondering how do you feel about this? Do you
want to just go back to FWD>> ten years ago, or do you enjoy it? 
Artwork 
I still go to FWD>>, I was there a couple of weeks ago, and I still
drink trampagne. (laughs) I don’t know, because we’re all still together,
we’re still the same group of friends. 
Audience member
Do you find it hard to keep up with Skream and Benga? 
Artwork 
I find it hard to keep up with them drinking-wise. 
Torsten Schmidt 
Who’s the fastest driver? 
Artwork 
That’s Benga. He’s fast. But yeah, everybody’s still in touch with each other,
and if you go and play or DJ at a dubstep thing somewhere, there’s going to be
someone you know, because you were there ten years ago, so it’s sort of like a
good little family. Everyone’s still in touch with each other, so it’s good. 
Audience member
I was just wondering if you find it overwhelming. 
Artwork 
I don’t think so, because it all moves on relatively. 
Audience member
My question is quite similar to hers, actually. I was going to ask what I
presumed he was trying to say, I was also going to defend
Cedric here (gestures to first audience member). I guess, what he was trying to say
was that obviously when you were making music back in the old days it was a
very underground thing, and as you know yourself, a lot of people involved in
the underground have very biased opinions. And when you start to do something
that’s on a different level, a lot of that kind of guys can be very negative
and very critique-y. 
So your music as Magnetic Man has skyrocketed in the last
year and it was a huge teenage student market that adhered to it, and I
presume coming from the underground perspective, do you feel like that was
overwhelming? I guess, you answered it when you said you just wanted to make
music that you love but if you could go back to when you were working at Big Apple… I mean, I worked at a record store and I know that the digital world is hard, but if you
could trade seats to go back to that stage in your life, but in 2011, when the
digital age didn’t take over, and records were still playing, and you and the
guys were still hanging out in the record shop, would you?
Artwork 
Oh, I’d definitely hang out in the record shop, because it was just so much
fun. It was a great time and we had the most fun. I think all of us would say
it was the best time of our lives. It was just absolute jokes all day, but
then these things come to an end, you move on, you do something else. You
could say, “I want to go back there,” all the time, and I think all of us
involved even now, when we go for a drink, talk about what it was like back in
those days in the shop because it was the best time. But things move on. 
Audience member
And when you were there, you were probably like, “Fuck, I want to get out of
this shop.” 
Artwork 
(laughs) Yeah, the grass is always greener. 
Audience member
So you’d go back for a day… 
Artwork 
I’d pay money for that, yeah. 
Audience member
That was not really what I tried to ask. I think it’s a very important thing
that you answer this question because probably, a lot of people in this room
have a problem with the mainstream industry. My question was more about
teaching: when you read interviews, Skream and Benga, they call you the
teacher, and in the studio, how important is it for you know to touch the
kids, or not at all maybe?
(laughter)
Maybe there is a misunderstanding? 
Artwork 
No (laughs), no, it’s just the sentence, “What do you feel about touching
kids?” It means ... 
Audience Member    
Sorry, it’s not my first language. 
Artwork    
No, I’m with you. I’m absolutely with you. I think it’s kind of like ... Yeah.
Audience Member    
Obviously when you’re a kid, you’re like a sponge, you absorb everything. No? This is gross again?
In terms of music, OK? Maybe the best thing to touch the feelings of the people, is when they are younger and still sensitive, and still don’t really understand what they listen to? I don’t know.
Artwork    
The thing really is, you don’t make music for a certain person. You can’t do that. You just cannot do that. You have to always make music for you and your friends. If you stop making music for your friends, you’re fucked. If you go into a room and think, “Oh, I’ve got to make music for this market, or for that person ...” Forget it, don’t bother. Just go and make music that you want to make.
At this stage, this is what we were like when we were making these tracks, we got with songwriters for the first time. We were allowed like, John Legend. Someone says, “Oh, you can do a track with John Legend.” You’re like, “Can I?” You just go and do it, and you make something that you really like. That’s all you can do. If it turns out that somebody likes it or somebody doesn’t like it, or blah, blah blah ... I don’t know, you just kind of make music that you like, that’s all there is to it.
I kind of see where you’re coming from there, I don’t know. We’re not trying to make anything for a specific market or anything like that, we’re just making music that we like.
Audience Member    
OK, I try one last time. The first time we had Young Guru, and who came from basically a really little city and who managed to break through to the industry, and he was talking about if you want to do it and get in the charts as number one, you have to do it, but you have to do it your way, doing the things you like.
Let’s get the kid thing away. What’s your opinion about this and how do you think the music you do now is the achievement of what you started ten years ago.
Artwork    
We just gave the record company an album of 15 tracks and we said this is what ... and if you listen to the album, the whole album, there’s tracks on there that aren’t like the ones I’ve just played, but then they get picked as the singles. When they get picked as singles they get played on radio, and when they get played on radio, the average listener of Radio 1 is 16-21 or something like that. Those people are the ones that listen to it, and they’re the ones that like it. If you listen to it as a whole album, there’s all different kind of styles that we went through and made. We do stand up for every kind of track, we loved making it and we like the songs.
Torsten Schmidt    
I guess what he’s getting at, if you do a new record or especially album with your mates, it’s you lot sitting down making a plan, puff! That’s how it’s done. All of a sudden, you get loads of A&Rs, distribution people, some TV pluggers or whatever, it’s like, “Oh no, no, we need to have this thing in there and we need to have that element in there, so we can satisfy that demographic,” and all that bullshit when you really know that, okay, all they care about is getting that year-end bonus, and not what’s going to happen with my record
Artwork    
Totally. We were very lucky, because they came to us, and they said, “Look, we see what you’re doing, you just do what you want to do, you make it, and give us it back.” So we did, we just went and made what we wanted to make. I’m sure it does happen, but we were quite lucky, because they did leave us alone, and we gave them what we wanted to give them.
Torsten Schmidt    
And Sarah punched them.
Artwork    
That’s the thing, because we had Sarah on our side, she’s like our manager, so she’s in there telling them exactly what’s what. You don’t argue with her.
Audience Member    
That’s what I wanted to say to the people. Thank you.
Artwork    
Cool. Yeah, we’ll leave the touching kids out of it too.
Audience Member    
Hello, a couple of months ago, I had the opportunity to interview Benga and we talked about finishing tracks, and I was just wondering, because he said he finished up his tracks in a day or two, and I was wondering just how much time do you need to finish up a track when you’re working on your own, not with Magnetic Man.
Artwork    
For me doing stuff, it’s a lot longer. I’ve seen, he’s just wild. He’ll sit down and start, and not eat until he’s finished. The Magnetic Man project that we were doing, each track was taking a lot longer, because it’s bounced around different people. When you do it ... making an album that three people have to okay. we’d send the backing track out, and maybe we’d have eight top lines back, by eight different songwriters. Then you listen to each one of them and then you’ve got to go through all of those. Then you have to find one and think, “Right, that’s good, now let’s go and record the vocal.” It’s a lot longer process for each record. Then you’ve got to mix it and stuff like that.
Audience member    
I’m not really familiar with your discography, but you don’t have an LP, right?
Artwork    
No.
Audience Member
How did you go about making an LP with Magnetic Man, because you have to have that distinct sound in LP? It’s not like singles. Singles you can have two tracks that are really different on the next, but on an LP, how did you go about doing that?
Artwork    
It was weird. We had forty-odd tracks that we’d done together and from that you can kind of pull them out to make a sort of shape, a rough shape for an album. Then you’re still kicking tracks off and putting new ones in and kicking it off until you get to a stage where you think, “OK, that’s what I want it to be.”
Audience Member    
Hey, what’s up. The reception in the UK has been really nice, what about outside of other parts of the world?
Artwork    
Really good. We just did a tour of Australia, about two weeks ago, which is really good. We did all the cities there. We’ve done America, which is cool. I think America’s just starting to get it now, they’re starting to get the whole dubstep thing.
Audience Member    
Has it been officially released in America, the record?
Artwork    
I think it has. It was kind of weird, it seems... to have just kicked off now, do you know what I mean? We released it last year, earlier in the year, so I think it’s kind of like...
Audience Member    
The dubstep scene back in America, was years behind. It’s just kind of making in roads within the last year, year and a half.
Artwork    
I think America’s ready for something new. I think it could be a really good fun out there.
Audience Member    
We have our own style, for better, for worse. They’re doing their own thing or whatever. Cool.
Torsten Schmidt
As the microphone travels over there, when you’re sitting in the diner or at the pizza stand in Coachella, and you got a bunch of heavy metal freaks going, “Yeah, Skrillex! Dubstep, yeah bro!” I’m like, “Right, why don’t you go wait and check out Magnetic Man and dem lot,” and they’re like “No, [inaudible].” How do you explain the difference to a young open mind like that? Why they should listen to you?
Artwork    
I love Skrillex stuff. He’s done amazing and the production is just unbelievable, but it’s all different. In that kind of world, of that sound, he’s unbelievable, he’s number one. It’s different sounds and again, it’s that thing of there’s the good stuff and there’s the bad stuff and there’s an awful lot of that bad sounding stuff. Heavy, kinda of noisy stuff that I’m not into. The very good stuff I really like, and I don’t know. You just kind of go for whatever. You just find... It’s personal as well, because what I think is good stuff, somebody else might think is not. It’s difficult to explain to anyone, but I think just find the good stuff, that’s all.
Torsten Schmidt    
Don’t be distracted by haircuts
Artwork    
No.
Audience Member    
Do you find that an album with a wide variety of styles on it is difficult for the public to accept?
Artwork    
I don’t know. I’ve thought some of my favorite albums are all sorts of different stuff. No, I don’t know. I don’t really think so.
Audience Member
You’re a long time vinyl peddler and vinyl DJ since the ‘90s and I’m just wondering when you plug into a really big system with a digital setup, do you find you have to really change your approach to avoid getting it brittle and trebbly? Do you do long sound checks to find how to play... 
Artwork
Yeah, with the Magnetic Man stuff we’re doing, we run it all through valve compressors and things like that to give it some warmth. We’ve got a sound guy, Johnny, that goes with us everywhere and he’s got some very special kit that boosts bottom end and things like that. There’s lots of weird kind of noise restrictions now at festivals that they’ve just brought in these new categories because they realize that people are putting it up at a certain decibel level but people were pushing frequencies that weren’t making it to off but now there’s new categories for all that sort of thing. It’s like a battle between the people that want to turn it down and the people that want to turn it up.
Audience Member    
Do the bass guys get away with it though? Because bass does produce a lot more decibels without hurting your ears, or feeling like it though.
Artwork    
Yeah, it’s weird, it’s like a fight between them. I don’t know who’s winning this week, but...
Audience Member    
Good luck mate.
Artwork    
Yeah, thanks.
Audience Member    
Just going to ask you one more quick question. You obviously signed to a major label this year and you never know, out of everybody here, anybody who watches this online, they might get put in that same position. Obviously, when a label comes at you with an offer, there’s obviously a lot of small print, a lot of things you’ve got to really look through. I was just wondering if I could get your advice on if Sony knock at anybody’s door tomorrow morning, or Universal, certain things that maybe... mistakes you have made or not, or just certain elements of signing with a major label that you should take account of.
Artwork    
Yeah, that’s a good point. I think that the most important thing, if you get any interests from anything like that, is to get yourself the best music lawyer you can, and ask everyone you know to find out who the best one is. Because you could look at it all day long and think, “This is absolutely great.” But there’s so many weird little things. They’ve been doing it for years. They’ve been doing it for 100 years or whatever it is, of making these deals that work well for them, and you need to have someone one your side that knows it as well as they do. Without them you’re completely and utterly lost. I think, it’s good if you get your deals laid out when you’re really hot. If they really want you, you can get a lot more than if they’re just um-ing ah-ing, which is obvious, but you can get away with a lot more.
Audience Member    
You wouldn’t necessarily believe in the phrase, “Never take anything from the label.” A few artists have told me, “Jesus, take as little, if nothing, off them as possible, you’ll be paying it back the rest of your fucking life.”
Artwork    
It depends because you can set up all sorts of different deals. You can set up deals just for that album. It used to be back in the day, deals would be cross-collateralized against. If your out with your first album, didn’t do so well, then your second, you’d be paying for that first album out of that one and it would go on and on and on. I think things have changed. Again, you’ve got to get that music lawyer that knows what he’s doing because they can do those things for you. But things are changing, because record labels are not selling the records that they used to and they’re going to want money for doing what they’re doing.
Audience Member    
Like gigs and stuff, do you reckon they’re going to start taking percentage at gigs?
Artwork
Yeah, the money’s going to have to come from somewhere, they’re big buildings with lots of people in them. They’re not selling the records that they were because everyone is just downloading it for free. If you’re going to get your music out to as many people as you can, you need those kind of people to do that for you. I think things are changing, it’s a weird world out there now. But there’s always deals to be done.
Audience Member    
Cheers, thanks.
Torsten Schmidt
Got one more? No? Do we got some music to end on a mildly more uplifting note than trying to save the recording industry. Could be anything, it’s a going away one.
Artwork    
Uplifting. OK, going away, all right.
Torsten Schmidt    
End of the night tune. Should we maybe give the man a hand before he plays the tune and thank him for being here.

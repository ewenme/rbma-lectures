Floating Points is many things. Musically, he’s a DJ, producer and co-founder of UK label Eglo Records, blending house, soul, hip-hop and jazz in myriad ways. He’s also Dr. Sam Shepherd: a neuroscientist who was writing music while studying for his PhD. It may seem like he lives two lives, but his work shows how a studious mind and a talent for experimental composition can intertwine. As well as solo productions for Eglo, he has collaborated with a 16-piece orchestra as the Floating Points Ensemble, and designed a DJ mixer with Isonoe. 
In his 2014 Red Bull Music Academy lecture, he talked about all of the above, as well as record collecting and his forays into Gnawa music.
Benji B
Please welcome Floating Points.
[applause]
Floating Points 
Thank you.
Benji B
We can call you Sam, right? Dr. Sam?
Floating Points 
[laughs] Yes, if you want.
Benji B
Okay. I think we should just start with asking you, Sam, what you’re up to at
the moment. First of all, before we get into that, what were we just listening
to?
Floating Points 
[placing vinyl in sleeve] That was Talk Talk, a big pop band. It’s their last record [Spirit of Eden]. It means a lot to a lot of people I think that’s why it became a cult record, and then got shelved as soon as it was released.
Benji B
What did it mean to you?
Floating Points 
It was a bit of a turning point just in a sort of introspective music. Just so
many elements to it, the recording... I don’t know, I can just listen to this
over and over again, and I hear something else in it each time I hear it. So
many of the techniques... The guy who recorded it is Phil Brown, and he wrote
a book about a lot of the work he did in recording. He worked for Island
Records, Bob Marley & The Wailers, a lot of the early stuff. He recorded
this, it took them over a year, I think, to record in Wessex Studios, in
London. And so, for example, the drums in that you heard were recorded with a
single U47, it’s a Neumann microphone about 30 feet from the drums. I heard
that and I was like, “OK, that’s how I’m going to record drums now.” I did a
record, it’s actually next to it, and a remix, and I recorded the drums in the
same way and I was trying to copy that, the way that record sounded. Yes, I’m
obsessed with this [Talk Talk] record.
Benji B
Obviously, we’re all music fans in the room but some people might not be
familiar with you or your work so far, and they will be by the end of the
lecture, but could you give us a bit of background on who you are, where
you’re from, and what you do for a living?
Floating Points 
Erm, I’m called Sam, 28, from Manchester [England] but I live in London now. I went... It’s
like a music school, as a child. It was at chorister at a cathedral in
Manchester, and I was at a school there for music and when my voice broke I
stayed on as a pianist and composer. I got quite heavily into jazz and
electronic music whilst I was there. And then I went to London for university,
a lot of my friends went to music college, but I went to do a normal degree in
pharmacology. Because my resources for musicians around me had kind of evaporated a
little bit, because I was just doing an academic university, I was making way
more electronic music, just by myself with my laptop, and going out quite a lot.
[laughs] And then from the friends I met through these events started
putting out my music, because no one... Well, there was people talking about
it, and I was like, “Well, I’ll have to do it myself.” And now I’m here. 
Benji B
And are you a formally trained pianist, or a musician, or self-taught?
Floating Points 
Yeah, I’m formally trained, I’m not very good. I’ve got my friends who are
killer pianists, but I can sort of get by, yeah. I can play.
Benji B
Was your background more classical, or jazz, or traditional? What was it?
Floating Points 
Initially, I guess, purely classical. I didn’t really enjoy playing the piano
for many years and it’s only until I started getting a bit better at it and I
could start choosing a repertoire I was playing then I started to enjoy it.
Then when I started getting into jazz that was when I really started to enjoy
it because that’s the sort of ultimate freedom. It all goes from just reading
the dots on the page to the piano becoming an extension of what you want to
do.
Benji B
Who are the composers that were the portal for that, for your discovery of new
music as a pianist?
Floating Points 
At the time a lot of French impressionist, so Debussy, Messiaen... I didn’t
actually see much harmonic sort of... I saw a lot of harmonic similarity in
the way a sort of Bill Evans voicing, Keith Jarrett sort of voicing would be
the way Debussy would treat harmony. That was a bridge, and maybe even some
Gershwin and Bernstein, but yeah, I saw so much similarity, I actually scored
a soft landing into the world of jazz. That’s when the record-buying started
because where I lived in Manchester, I lived in the city center, the cheapest
way for me to get hold of music, the only way actually, was the local record
shops. There was a few streets there which have got some amazing record shops,
and back then, sort of the beginning of CDs, when they were 25 quid [pounds] or
something, and everyone was getting rid of their records, I got some really
great jazz records quite early on. And had a good piano teacher Les Chisnall
and Steve Barry. They were really instrumental in focusing me, quite early on,
in really good jazz. I’m indebted to them.
Benji B
When did it move into this electronic realm? What was your first...?
Floating Points 
At the same time my school had a fancy new digital studio and they had an old
studio that was an Atari, it was an old black-and-white computer that you had
to install Cubase every time you turned it on. That was plugged into an Akai
S-950 and the S-950 went into a multi-track. Back then I was sampling stuff
but I was sampling things like keys jangling, and vacuum cleaners. One of the
early tunes I did, “Vacuum Boogie,” was from a sample that I had from the
S-950, still on a floppy disk, so that’s my parents’ Dyson hoover.
[laughter]
Benji B
Can we hear about the “Vacuum Boogie”?
Floating Points 
Yeah, I don’t really...
Benji B
Just to give you a bit of context to this lecture, me getting Sam to play any
of his old music is a bit like getting blood out of a stone because he hates
hearing anything more than six months old which is why I started with
something brand new. So the more you can help me encourage him to play some of
the older stuff, the better.
Floating Points 
You’ll hear...
Benji B
You don’t have to play the whole thing.
Floating Points 
Yeah, you’ll hear the sample in the first second, so we can stop listening to
it after that.
(music: Floating Points – “Vacuum Boogie” / applause)
Benji B
Was that one of the first tunes you put out?
Floating Points 
Yeah, I think so. On Eglo [Records], it’s number two, it’s the second record.
Benji B 
Cool. What was that made on?
Floating Points 
That was made on a Virgin train from Manchester to London, on my headphones.
Because I remember picking up the sample at home and then being on the train
on my way back and I just made it on... Because you can press Caps Lock and
get keyboards on your computer, so I just made the...
Benji B
On Logic.
Floating Points 
Logic, yeah. So it was... Yeah, it was a train journey.
Benji B
Moving, as you were saying, getting into records and getting into electronic
producing and stuff, what were the moments that made you want to start DJing?
Who were the DJs that influenced you the most?
Floating Points 
I was DJing at school, doing school-disco kind of things. I was buying a lot of
records then, when I was young. I was obviously way more selective, because I
was a kid and I had no money, but when I moved to London I was going to a lot
of parties, and back then I was really into drum & bass, like crazy. I’ll
fast-forward a bit, I’ll just answer the question. Who made me start taking it
seriously was people like Ade [Fakile] from Plastic People, Theo [Parrish] at Plastic, and some other nights at Plastic People, and other nights at Deviation, like your own night. That’s when I started taking it a bit more seriously. And
also, my friend, Tom and I started a party in London when we were 18,
when we were students, at a venue called The Rhythm Factory on a Wednesday night.
It was a night for a cancer charity, and it was quite successful, actually. We
raised quite a lot of money and it was really good fun. He would do the main
room, him and Toby, and then me and my friends would do the other room. The
same people owned a venue called The Gramaphone, and upstairs at The
Gramaphone I would DJ on a Friday night there, just all night. It built up a
bit of steam, people were coming down to it. The people who gave me the
confidence to really... The idea of recontextualizing a lot of records I had, or there
was a lot of records I had but wouldn’t ever think I could play them in a
dance situation, were people like Ade, Theo, and the other nights going on at
Plastic, like Nonsense. Ade was really especially important, because you’d go
down and the way he plays I can’t really describe it. The music is so
inviting. It’s like the music is reaching out of the speakers and dragging you
closer, almost as if the shape of the room changes with the music. Plastic
People’s an extremely dark space, and for the club to feel light through music
is something Ade managed to do, I think.
Benji B 
Could you just explain what Plastic People is, where it is, and who Ade is?
Floating Points 
Okay. Plastic People is a club in London, in East London. It’s a 200-capacity
basement and it’s got a ridiculous soundsystem. There’s been two incarnations
of the system whilst I’ve been around. The old one was a Funktion-One, the new one’s a
custom thing. The old one was just so loud, I mean, the sound is amazing and
especially when he brought out these fancy old German broadcast turntables,
called EMTs [Elektro-Mess-Technik]. The pre-amp inside those is phenomenal, and the sound of records
when he played on those it was just something else. You can’t describe it.
Hearing music in that space on that system with the people that frequented it
and the people who were, obviously, most instrumental to the actual party was
a real turning point in the way I DJed, I think. In playing, not feeling like
it’s a problem to play jazz records in a club.
Benji B 
Have you got a record that you’d like to play to sort of illustrate that era?
Floating Points 
Let me see. This is an Ade classic, it’s Azymuth’s first album. All the tunes
are kind of good but this one, especially the drums, sound sick.
Benji B
I should mention, as well, that it’s significant to say that Ade owns the
club.
Floating Points 
Oh, yeah. That’s Ade’s club.
Benji B
And used to do once a week on a Saturday, and crucially not mixing many of the
records, right? That’s an important thing to mention about the EMTs.
Floating Points 
Yeah, technically. He used to hit the start/stop button so hard, sometimes the
needle would skip. His style was amazing though, because you’d get halfway
through a record, and he’d just be like, stop, start another one. It would be
“Strawberry Fields” into a
Mala dubplate that no one
had and then go into some
Recloose thing and then
he’d go into this [points at desk], and then into Pharoah Sanders and he’d play all 20 minutes
of it, and... It’s nuts. It’s the only time I’ve cried in the club.
[laughter]
It was Marvin Gaye, “What’s Going On.”
(music: Azymuth – “Manha” / applause) 
Benji B
Classic Brazilian Azymuth, that I know went on to influence your approach to
sound and drums and stuff, right?
Floating Points 
That record, yeah. I mean, there’s so many records that I heard in that space that
informed the way I would try and make music. I don’t really know, in the
studio I don’t know what I’m doing, I just know what I’d like to think I know
what I like the sound of. It’s all about experimenting, so it took me about
five years to realize the Coles 4038 [microphone], which we’ve got downstairs
above the drums at the moment, for me, it gives the best image of a drum kit
in certain situations, but it always gives me a really nice recording sound.
So, I’ve learnt the long way. I don’t know how they managed to get the sound on
that and I’d hate to find out it’s just one mic. I mean, it’s 90% the player.
Benji B
And talk to me about the sound that you identify that you like, because you do come
across as a complete connoisseur of sound for someone so young, it’s true.
What was your journey of discovery in identifying the palette and the textures
in sound that meant the most to you?
Floating Points 
Purely recordings, listening to recordings and hearing so many different
styles of recording. As people were walking in and I was playing that Steve
Kuhn, [holds up record] and I don’t know if you noticed, the voice was super up-front in the mix,
and you can see the picture of the mic there [points], it’s a broadcast microphone.
Things like that made me feel it’s all right to experiment with the way I
record things. Although there’s no right way or wrong way to do it, perhaps.
Using studios, being in studio situations with people, producing people’s
records, using equipment, pretending I know what I’m doing but actually I have
no idea, and just saying, “Oh yeah, I’ll use that microphone because it looks
funny,” and then all the engineers are like, “What are you doing?”
Benji B
Yeah.
Floating Points 
And then getting interesting results with it. And sometimes not working at
all, but that doesn’t matter.
Benji B
And do you have a space of your own that you can record live music in?
Floating Points 
Right. When I started my post-graduate study five years ago, I started
building a studio in London, sort of for the record label I started, and for artists
that are on it, and also for my own stuff. Yeah, it’s kind of a big space, maybe
two-thirds of this room. It’s one big space with a console in it and stuff, recording
stuff, synthesizers and microphones. Recently, since finishing university
properly, I’ve finally soldered the patch bay completely. It’s good to have
that space, and not have the pressure to... A lot of studios are super
expensive, daily rates and things like that, so you don’t really want to be
wasting time. This is much more relaxed.
Benji B
Seeing as you’re someone who has invested so much time in discovering exciting
bits of old equipment and finding out the sounds of things that you love, if you
were to recommend people three or four essential bits, must-have starter bits
for live recording, which little bits of gear would you pick?
Floating Points 
That’s so hard. I really don’t want to say. Outboard mixers, of whatever caliber, you’ll always have, I think, more control over a mix than doing inside the box. But then you can get
such good results from a computer. I made all my first records, just
completely, just the headphone output of my laptop, so I don’t know. I can’t
answer that, it’s too difficult. It’s a question of budget, anyways, isn’t it?
So it’s too difficult to answer for me. I don’t know, sorry.
Benji B
No, that’s cool. Let’s talk about a different subject, you mentioned finishing
uni. You’ve been busy with something else. Music is not the only thing in your
life, right, Dr. Sam Shepherd?
Floating Points 
Right. Yeah, so I finished uni, and then I worked for a year for Cancer
Research UK, working the clinical trials and stuff. And then whilst I was
there I applied for a PhD, because I got really into neuroscience in doing my
degree. So I applied for a PhD, got the PhD, and then that was in
neurogenetics of pain, so I was interested in the peripheral sensory neurons
that encode pain sensations, and the DNA inside those single neurons, and the
way in which machinery works in those cells can be modulated in pain states.
And so we try and hijack that system therapeutically, hopefully to find different
ways of treating pain. So, I finished that earlier this year.
Benji B
Is pain just in the mind, then?
Floating Points 
All pain is in the brain, yeah. I don’t want to get into this. [laughs] You
know, people will definitely fall asleep. Yeah, it was a really great time. My
professor, John Wood, he’s an amazing guy who was very, very supportive of all
my musical endeavors as well, so he was always happy for my to run off on a
Friday to Heathrow to go and do a gig. So yeah, I learned so much there, there was a good soldering iron there as well, [laughs] so if I needed to make wires.
Benji B
You successfully completed your PhD, right? Congratulations on becoming Dr.
Simon Shepherd. Dr. Flo-Po!
[applause]
How did the relationship between science and music work during that time? How
did you balance the lifestyles, and did one complement the other?
Floating Points 
It was quite difficult in terms of time. I live very near the university so
that was very convenient for me in terms of not wasting much time. I do the
sort of nine to five, six or whatever, and then go home and make music. And sometimes
with science, especially if you’re doing nine to three AM or something, and sometimes the experiment doesn’t work at all. So you leave at midday, although you
shouldn’t. Any free time I’d make music, and I think they didn’t really feed
each other in terms of the overlap of the process of science and music, only
insomuch that hypothesizing is a creative process. I think music was
definitely a release for me, when I’d go home, and when something’s not
working which it inevitably doesn’t in genetics. I’d go home and make music,
and be able to switch off a bit, and that was definitely nice.
Benji B
Sort of release or escape.
Floating Points 
Definitely, yeah. Even listening to music was...
Benji B 
Let’s listen to another record, why don’t you pick one of your favorites. You
brought a selected few today.
Floating Points 
This is Air, the Air album. I think everyone should... This is a New York
group. It’s very difficult to actually play anything off of this because it’s
all so good... 
Audience Member
“Mr. Man”!
Floating Points 
[laughs] “Mr. Man,” yeah, there you go. We got a request.
(music: Air – “Mr. Man”)
[comments] It’s Googie Williams, no, Googie Coppola, she’s a singer, and her
way of singing melodies is just amazing.
[applause]
Benji B
When did you discover that one?
Floating Points 
It was Sean McAuliffe, who’s a part of the Nonsense Crew from Plastic People,
he played it on a radio show once. And he played “Jail Cell,” which I just
couldn’t believe it, so if you ever see this record, definitely pick it up.
It’s amazing.
Benji B
We can all tell by now that you’re a serious record digger and record
collector, but I know that you’re also a staunch vinyl enthusiast and that is
your preferred medium. Do you want to talk to us about why that is?
Floating Points 
I got into records, as I said, just because it was the easiest format for me to get music
when I was younger. I think maybe, if it had been now I don’t know if I would
be. It’s definitely a sort of... A problem. It’s kind of developed into... I don’t fetishize
it in any way, but I do definitely enjoy the process of finding music, digging
through music. When I was at uni, I’d go to the States, I’d buy a ticket to
Chicago with my student loan [laughs] and then figure out how to actually eat. And then
go over and buy as many records as possible because it worked out so much
cheaper, and discovered so much in that process of going to places, meeting
people at record stores. That sort of advice you get from a guy at a shop,
like Peabody’s Records, Mark and Mike Grusane will always beat a Juno
recommendation based on, “This, you’re going to like this.” It’s going to be
way more wild, you’re going to find way more wild music in that process. The
value of record shops, record dealers, I think, were paramount in me
discovering interesting music. That’s why, if there was a MP3 dealer or
something that did the same thing, maybe I’d be into that as well, but... Yeah, I got
really into records.
Benji B 
Talking of Chicago and the amazing tradition of DJing that’s come from there,
you are quite rare for a younger DJ, if that’s okay to say, in the sense that
you have taken the baton of that tradition, of chasing the pitch and playing
classics and DJing, for the most part, unquantized live music, and you take
that art form seriously. Is that something you had to study and practice for a
while?
Floating Points 
It was actually the first time Mark and Mike at Peabody’s, in the south of
Chicago. They would open their shop at ten o’clock in the morning, close it at
ten, midnight, whatever. The whole day they were DJing. People would bring
records in and they would just be going through records and be like, “Yes,
OK,” throw it on, and they’d just ride pitch control. First time I’d ever
seen it, and I was like, “That’s crazy.” That’s how you actually mix two live
records. I thought, “I’m going to copy them.” I went back to London and
started doing it, and just practicing. I don’t have a pair of turntables at
home, now, I only have one, so I can’t really practice. I probably should
though. It was out of necessity, really, because a lot of the music that I
wanted to play, especially because of the music I was buying, was unquantized.
And I was playing, at this point, I was doing the bar thing, The Gramaphone. I
had to, it was out of necessity. I was playing a little bit of house music and
stuff.
Benji B
That summarizes what you’re best known for as a DJ. If I think about your set,
I will think about a bit of house music and some modern stuff but generally,
for the most part, older music, or music from the crate, sort of thing. What
is it about older music, why is that your preferred era to draw from?
Floating Points 
I don’t know.
Benji B
Is it that you don’t like much new music?
Floating Points 
No, that’s absurd. No, because I really do enjoy music, I buy a lot of new
music and I go to the record shop every week and buy records. And I do DJ them
a little bit but not nearly as much as the other stuff. There’s definitely a
certain aesthetic in the older music that I play that I search for in new
music, and that’s the kind of, the aesthetic I want to be playing in a club, this
inviting thing, the Ade thing, of warmth. So if it’s a brand-new cold techno
record, I might not be interested in playing it at the sort of events that I
do. But then I would not say that I would never play them because contrast is
great. It’s a very tricky question and I don’t know why I don’t play as much
at the moment. It goes through phases, at the moment I’m going through a crazy
modern soul phase, I went through a Brazilian phase a few years ago. I think
I’m starting to calm down on the modern soul stuff that I’m getting really in
to.
Benji B
How do you define modern soul? What is that?
Floating Points 
The way I’m thinking about it is late, mid- to late ‘70s soul, where soul
started crossing over into disco, so you’d find a lot of disco records on 45 [RPM].
In fact, this is a perfect example, my friend Julia showed me this record
about five years ago, and it was such a mad turning point for me that we
started a little party in London and New York called You’re A Melody because
of this tune. This is where I am when I started getting into modern soul.
(music: Aged In Harmony – “You’re A Melody” / applause)
Benji B
So, go on and tell us, what’s the craziest amount [you paid for a record]? What’s
the most you’ve gone to? Is that off limits, that question?
Floating Points 
Yeah, because it’s going to get worse. Through this record, I met a lot of
people through gaining these records, like DJ Love On The Run from New York,
DJ McBoing Boing from New York; and Jeremy Underground Paris, as well, he’s
really into this stuff, and Pearl Girls, Julie and Anna, who DJ as Javibes.
They’ve taught me so much about this music and so I am highly indebted to them
for this sort of knowledge. And Red Greg as well, in London, these guys have
taught me a lot about this music. I really wish I could play all these to you
because they’re so beautiful, these records.
Benji B
Is it true that you once swapped a 7” record for a car?
Floating Points 
[laughs] Yeah, that’s true. I can’t even drive so I gave the car to my
girlfriend. It was a really nice record but it was a nice car as well, so
everyone won.
Benji B 
Tell me about your mixer of choice. I know that you have had a dedication to
the highest level in all things and that’s culminated in an amazing new
project, you pretty much built an amazing new DJ mixer. Tell us about the
journey of your taste in mixers and why you’ve chosen them and why you have
eventually chosen to build one yourself.
Floating Points 
I’m into good-sounding stuff, records, mixers, anything that makes a record, I’m into it
sounding good. I’m sure everyone will agree there. There’s certain mixers that
I feel don’t sound good because they digitize the signal, and you can hear
that, and there’s some mixers that I don’t like the feel of them, like some of
the upfade, these faders, they feel okay, but there’s certain mixers where
their faders are too loose, and things like that. There’s a certain ergonomic
thing about it, as well. The way the record sounds on some mixers I just find
really unpleasant, and having used a few mixers like Bozak and Urei, things
like this, they sound really nicely. And the control you have, the fade, the
linearity of the volume going up and down, it feels like you’re controlling a
gas fire, or something. The power of the fade feels much... I can’t use
words to describe it, you just have to try it out. I’m not into rotary mixers
but I’m into good-sounding mixers, and it just so happens that most rotary pots
are made to a higher specification, maybe. I don’t know what it is, but the
mixer in my studio has linear faders, but in the DJ world the most ergonomic
fade is on rotary. A friend of mine builds equipment and we thought we’d try
and build a class-A mixer, so the circuitry... It’s a nice circuit, basically.
It sounds very, very nice, very, very transient mixers, and then summing’s
really pleasant. You’re welcome to come try it out sometime. It’s sitting in
Plastic People.
Benji B
Yeah, you can’t travel with that, right? How big is it? How big is the power
supply?
Floating Points 
The power supply’s at 4U, and then the mixer itself is like 8U. But it’s about
42kg in total, so it’s quite heavy, it’s really heavy. Trying to lift it up the stairs myself... [laughs] Yeah.
Benji B
What have you learned in your journey of learning about mixers? What have you
learned makes a good DJ mixer? What makes a DJ mixer sound good? What is the
specifics of what you were just describing?
Floating Points 
The technical side of it?
Benji B
Yeah.
Floating Points 
I’m not really an expert.
Benji B
Is it good pots, is it good circuitry...?
Floating Points 
Yeah, good circuitry, decent power supply. And if it’s a fancy mixer with all
the effects and things like that, a good conversion. Because I think that the
DACs [digital/analog converters] in some of these mixers aren’t really up to
the standard of the studios that use DACs that were recording the music. So it
feels like a bottleneck, basically, in the whole process. You’ve got amazing
speakers, good crossover, decent amps, CDJs sound amazing, needles and mixers
can sound good. The mixer sometimes, I feel, it’s the weakest link in the
chain. So it’s basically an endeavor to make something that I felt really
comfortable with, because I do a party as Plastic People, now, on a regular
basis, and that soundsystem is so good that it deserves to have as good a
signal as possible. And when you get to the crossover at that club it’s
everything before it, the mixer and the turntables is the weakest part of it.
It’s an endeavor for trying to reproduce the music as well as possible.
Benji B
You designed it yourself, basically.
Floating Points 
I actually drew it on the back of an envelope and gave it to McKenna. It was
relatively hands-off, because I really don’t know much about the technical
stuff, you know? I’ve heard different examples of different transformers and
things like this but it gets very, very nerdy very, very quickly, that world
of nickel and...
Benji B
But it’s got isolators on it?
Floating Points 
Yeah, it’s got an isolator on each channel. And the weird thing about it is
the channel one, channel two on top of each other, so the faders are kind of like
that. And then the idea is that you can have the isolators down on one
channel, you can swap the bass lines over, swap the mids over, swap the treble
over, and if you’re playing electronic music that’s quantized you can create
really nice fades. So rather than using volume you can fade different parts of
the frequency spectrum over. That was the impetus behind that.
Benji B
Somewhere in between record-digging, becoming a doctor, and doing a PhD,
composing, and producing, you also have time to run a record label. Tell us
about Eglo Recordings.
Floating Points 
It started, actually, at CDR’s night in London. I think it happens elsewhere
in the world now where you go down with work you’ve been working on and you
share it with everyone. And it’s really highly recommended by people who know
about it. You go down everybody plays their music, they put it up on a
projector whose track it is. I went down there once with a tune called “For
You” which is kind of like a hip-hop thing. It was Alex Nut who was there,
he’s a DJ on Rinse FM. He was asking Tony
[Nwachukwu], the
guy who runs it, whose record was playing, he pointed at me, sort of a nerdy
guy in the corner, and he was like, “It doesn’t really fit, it doesn’t fit my
demeanor.” He’s like, “What are you doing with this record?” I’m like,
“Nothing, I’m just making music for fun.” He’s like, “Let’s put it out.” We
didn’t have a clue what we were doing, we just went down to Transition, which
was the place to cut at the time, it was where all the dubstep guys were
getting all their stuff cut. We got it cut to a 45, and then I actually kept
it in the fridge in the university for two weeks before, whilst we were trying
to find out what we do next. We took it down to the plant to get it turned
into a stack of records and then we shopped them out to shops. From that we
got a company, Kudos Records in London, they hit us up and were like, “Do you
want us to do your distribution for you?” Which was really useful because going
to the post office 500 times is really not much fun. That’s how it started.
Benji B
What should we play from the Eglo catalog?
Floating Points 
Erm... Well I’ve got music from myself and Fatima.
Benji B
Yeah, cool.
Floating Points 
Yeah?
Benji B
Box fresh, yeah?
Floating Points 
[unwrapping new record] Yeah. I don’t know. Lots of big tunes on this.
Benji B
Just quickly, who’s Fatima?
Floating Points 
Fatima is a singer. Again, we met her at Plastic People. She used to jump on
the mic at a lot of parties in London, and would just smash it, it was crazy.
It would just be a party, and this girl would turn up and start singing,
and the whole thing was... It was a crazy time. And yeah, we started working on music a long time ago. Actually, I’m going to play something else. [changes record] We started
working on music a long time ago, on a record that came out a few years ago,
called Mind Traveling EP. It’s a four-tracker, and it took us so long to
make this record because we became really good friends, we would hang out,
basically, rather than making music. So, this is the first thing we did together.
This track, maybe. With your help from the radio, it blew up, this record, so
thank you. [laughs]
(music: Fatima feat. Floating Points – “Mind” / applause) 
Benji B
That’s music from Fatima produced by Floating Points, Eglo #14 I can see on
there. How many releases are you up to now on the label?
Floating Points 
43 are in manufacture at the moment.
Benji B
And can you give us some names of other artists you’ve released?
Floating Points 
There’s Fatima, FunkinEven, Shuanise, there’s
Flako, Shafiq Hussein, me.
Benji B
It seems like with the names you bring up and what you’ve been talking about,
that music scenes, or maybe better put, music communities, have been important
to you in both meeting people but also in musical discovery as well, and a
support network as well. Is that fair to say?
Floating Points 
Right. Yeah, through the music I play, from friends teaching me about music, to the
record I put out, these were all friends. So Fatima, Stevie, FunkinEven, everyone we put out we had a personal relationship with, like we’ve met them, we’re
friends. Stevie, we didn’t know he was making music we were just friends with
him and he’s like, “Oh, I make tracks.” And it was killer tracks, so, yeah, we
put those out. It’s felt a lot nicer doing things that way.
Benji B
What was your first? Was it the “Invisible” remix that was it one of the
first. Or was it “The Wires”? What was the first live thing you put out?
Floating Points 
There’s a 10" I did on Ninja Tune a few years ago which was a live, more orchestral
thing. That was a band that I sort of had at school I’d written a few things
for and we reconvened in London to record this. We got asked to do a Maida
Vale session for Gilles’
[Peterson] show,
and they thought, I think, that I was going to turn up with a laptop at Maida
Vale and I turned up with 16 people. We recorded that, and then Ninja Tune re-
recorded it again. We did that at Abbey Road, in fact, when I was there that’s
when I sort of stole all of their techniques, like how to record things, just
picking up, just observing how these engineers were working, because I think
it’s a good-sounding record. That was the first orchestral stuff, and then
actually straight after that, we recorded the “Wires” track and that was in
2009, I think, and that only came out last year. Because it was such a
collage, it took me so long to put it together.
Benji B
Do you just record lots of material and then comp the best bits kind of thing?
Floating Points 
I had a plan and a score for it, but the way I recorded it, because, again, I
didn’t really know what was I was doing, I recorded a massive long drum track
and then put everything on top of it and recorded phrases. There’s a horn
section, which is doing these massive arpeggios, which, if you listen to it
it’s impossible to actually play because they never breathe. That was some
copy and pasting stuff, and there’s actually a section right at the very
beginning which was, I’d just heard that “Sand and Rain” record, who’s that
by? The French record “Sand and Rain”? No. Anyway, I’d just heard that and I
was like, “That’s amazing.” And there was a [Hammond] B3 organ in the studio,
I’d never played one before, and so we tacked that stuff on the beginning of
the record. We had two days in the studio, just experimenting.
Benji B
You were mentioning about that Steve, or was it the Talk Talk record that
influenced The Invisible...?
Floating Points 
Right, yeah, the recording.
Benji B
Do you literally hear something and think, “I like the sound of that,” and
then research how they did it and then have a go at it?
Floating Points 
For that, yeah. The thing is Phil Brown wrote a book and there was a big
section on recording of that album. So, yeah, I tried to copy it.
Benji B
I think The Invisible remix is pretty amazing. We should probably listen to
that before we wrap it up. 
Floating Points
[unwraps new record] 
Benji B
All your personal records are completely unopened,
just travel with a new one every time. [laughter] Anything you want to say about this
before we play it? Because we should probably listen to most of it.
Floating Points 
This is kind of a prototype for what I was trying to get into myself, for my
own stuff. It was this idea of a Buchla being the main drum sound, the
percussive elements, and then drums on the top. This is a band, The Invisible,
a really, amazing, amazing band, I think, and really good friends of mine.
They’ve got a studio around the corner from mine, so we hang out a lot. And so I did
this for them. In fact, I used Dave Okumu’s, who is the singer, I
used his backing vocal as the main vocal, and he came and resang it, as like a
main line. And then I recorded the drums myself, they we’re a little bit
cack-handed. I don’t know what speed it is.
(music: The Invisible – “Wings (Floating Points remix)” / applause)
Benji B
Right, it’s question time. I don’t know if anyone’s got a starter?
Audience Member 
What was that track called?
Floating Points 
The band’s called The Invisible and the track’s called “Wings.”
Audience Member 
Hey.
Floating Points 
Hi.
Audience Member 
Let me just make a preface first, I’m a Brazilian so I see you are into a lot
of Brazilian stuff. Actually, I was listening to the mixtape of just Brazilian
music released, like, four months ago, and I saw that you put some Hareton
Salvanini stuff [on there] and he worked with my father on a lot of records.
And it’s amazing that you know him because even in Brazil he is not very
known. The thing is, I saw also that you did a residency in Morocco a while
back and in the situation that you were into, it was like you were trying
mixing electronic music with, not fusion, right, but like making music with
traditional music and electronic stuff, right? Brazil is a big country and we
are very closed on ourselves so it’s kind of hard to make something different
and being not pinpointed. They have preconceived ideas about using a lot of
electronic stuff, and so I wanted to know, what was the guidelines you used
for making music with Gnawa people in Morocco?
Floating Points 
Okay. We went over there not knowing really what to expect. I had heard
Gnawa music, but I didn’t know much about it. There was no pressure on us
to do anything, to actually come up with anything, so my biggest fear was that
it would be a fusion thing. I could play you, actually, what I did.
Audience Member 
Yeah, yeah, please.
Floating Points 
If that’s okay? This is probably going to be easier. This is the first time
that I worked with Mahmoud Guinia, and this is the first time he and his
fellow musicians played to a click track, so it was quite an interesting
experience for all of us. And James
Holden was there as
well, we were working together on a lot of stuff. I think this might be the
one, lets see.
(music: Maâlem Mahmoud Guinia & Floating Points – “Mimoun Marhaba”) 
[comments] It’s recorded outside because everything’s tiled in Morocco, so
we recorded outside. You can actually hear the birds. The musicians are
clapping, and the sense of rhythm is something that I still can’t put my
finger on.
[applause]
That didn’t actually answer your question.
Audience Member 
It’s like the music continues to be their own, right? It’s like you are just
making the... Circulating it around.
Floating Points 
Right. I felt like we were making music together, and that’s something I was
really scared of, was: “They’re going to play, I’m going to play, and
there’s going to be nothing going on between us.” Whilst we were playing
there’s smiles going on, it was such a positive experience, the whole week was
really amazing. Me and James, and Vessel, and Biosphere were there as well. I
was so nervous that nothing fruitful would come of it, or there would just be
a complete breakdown of understanding. And even though the triplet clapping,
then... It’s not a triplet, I can’t work out what it is. It’s so groovy, all
the music is so groovy, but I can’t do it. It’s not inherently difficult to
play a qaraqib, but it is the way they do it. It’s super impressive and
there’s a festival in Essaouira once a year, about the same time as SONAR, of
Gnawa music, it’s highly recommended, it’s a really, really amazing
festival.
Audience Member 
Thanks.
Audience Member 
Hey, thanks for everything you’ve shared with us, I’m totally amazed. And I
wrote my question, because everything that you’ve shown from your work, I feel
it has... If you trust elements in time, is that a conscious way of working?
Because they have that perspective in not having a rush about everything that
has to appear in a song. Because I really love that you trust what you have,
you don’t rush anything. I love that.
Floating Points 
I think it’s definitely a dilemma I have, is that...
Benji B
She means all your records are really long, bruv.
[laughter]
Audience Member 
No!
Benji B
I’m just kidding.
Floating Points 
It’s funny though because a lot of Brazilian music, like Hareton Salvanini he
cuts to the chase. This album is probably... How many tracks? Six tracks per
side, each song is two and a half minutes, three minutes long. With a lot of
Brazilian music, it’s so hard to DJ because by the time it’s started it’s
over. Then you’re like, “Oh, here’s the next record.” It’s something that I’m
trying to actually make, shorter pieces of music, but then I find it very
difficult to [make them shorter]. You’re right, I like things to breathe and
have their own space.
Audience Member 
Hi. I am very interested in physics but I’m really uneducated.
Floating Points 
This makes two of us. [laughs]
Audience Member 
I was interested in the point where you were talking about your doctorate, and
I was wondering what role do you think music plays in evolution? Because at
this point I feel like a lot of music is meant to enforce capitalism in a way,
it’s all about aesthetic. And I felt like a lot of the stuff you played was
very emotive and very progressive, and I thought it was funny that nearly
everything had a significant modulation, you said that the DNA had a
modulation because of pain. And I was wondering if you could talk more about
that even though you said you didn’t want to.
Floating Points 
Okay. The thing that I was particularly interested in is called epigenetics,
and so you’ve got your DNA code. It’s the four letters A, G, C, T, and for a
long time it’s believed that that code defined everything about you, all your
physical traits, where your nose is, the way your eyes are, you know, your hair color,
things like this. Over the past maybe 50 years – I’m going to get so panned on
nature of neuroscience for this – a field’s emerged called epigenetics, so it’s
like the way in which that code itself exists within a cell. So the way in
which it’s folded up, because DNA has to pack itself really, really tightly,
and for that DNA to be turned into what is gonna turn into you, proteins, that it has to
unfold and reveal itself and be made available to be read, like the doors of
the library have to open. I was interested in the gatekeeper to that door,
basically, and so we’re looking at tiny, tiny, little proteins inside cells
that open the DNA and close the DNA up. We found in pain that those things
change, doors open, doors close as well, different parts of the DNA, and so
we’re trying to find a way of closing some doors and opening other doors to
the DNA code to normalize the pain. The link to music, I’m sure I could
waffle on for long enough before one emerges but I have not thought about it,
sorry. Sorry.
Audience Member 
Hello.
Floating Points 
Hi.
Audience Member 
This might be slightly presumptuous, but you seem quite, like, a restless guy
when it comes to darting into new projects and leaving things behind, but you
are evidently very dedicated as well. And I think this is kind of a question
of the divides of dedication, and speaking of the Talk Talk album, and other
peeps who invest a lot of time into a singular piece of work, how do you
manage your über-considered projects alongside a route to being a prolific
artist, and how do you balance those outlets?
Floating Points 
You mean, having lots of interests in different kind of music, or in different
things?
Audience Member 
Yeah, or getting tired of work that you’ve done before or wanting to move on,
and how long do you invest in each time?
Floating Points 
Right. The thing that played right at the beginning, that’s something I
started five years ago, and recorded actually most of it back then. In fact,
the reason I played you the wrong mix is because literally I have no idea, I
can’t remember. I just started working on it again, trying and finishing it
off. I have lots of different things on the go at the same time, whether it’s
dance music, whether it’s not dance music, and I don’t finish them all. Like I
don’t start them and finish them in the same period of time, it’s a very
protracted process. And most of the things that I’ve put out, actually, have been... I did
a record called “Shadows,” it’s a double-pack. All the music on that, from the
day it released, was at least two years old, up to nine years old, actually.
That’s probably not answering your question.
Audience Member 
Yeah, you definitely are. Do you abandon your music? Is that how you get it
out? Do you know what I mean?
Floating Points 
Yeah, actually you’re right. With that “Shadows” record, this one, putting it
out was kind of like, “I’m done with it now.” A lot of my music is like that.
I sit with it for a long, long time, and nothing changes, but suddenly I was
like, “Okay, I’m ready to put out that one.” I wish I was a little bit faster [laughs]
with deciding. I don’t know what it is, I think I just need to live with it
for a bit, within myself, before I’m happy for other people to hear it.
Audience Member 
That’s reassuring.
Floating Points 
Yeah, there’s no rush, basically. 
Audience Member 
Hi. There is some kind of lovely and deep sense of distance in your music. I
wonder how would you approach that space, not just in the technical way, also
how do you visualize when you’re writing your music, that feeling? I also want
to know, you mentioned a book when you just started the lecture, and I want to
know the name of the book.
Floating Points 
It’s by an engineer called Phil Brown and he’s still going, actually, still
working. I think he recorded Dido’s albums, as well, and did some big, big pop
projects. The book’s got tales of Bob Marley recordings with the Wailers, some
really interesting acts in there, actually. It doesn’t get very technical, but
it just so happened this one little nugget of information I was looking for
was in there, the drum thing. Especially, yeah, with Talk Talk, he actually
does go into detail. Talking about space... Technically it’s much easier to
answer. Over the years, I’ve developed ways that feel comfortable to me to
create space in a mix. So I listen to a lot of my old records, like “Vacuum,”
for example, it sounds like one big blob of sound to me. But whereas the
“Shadows” thing feels way more open and has a virtual space, every instrument
has its own space in the mix. I think that’s mostly a function of getting an
outboard mixer. For me, that’s technically what helped me. I used an API, it’s
a mixing console, and it’s very easy to use because you can make the most tiny
adjustments and you can hear them. And that hands-on approach gave me that
sense of space. It’s something that I felt I wasn’t achieving in computer, from just a stereo out.
Musically, a sense of space... Dynamics. I’m a sucker for reverb and good-
sounding reverbs. I spend a lot of time listening to reverbs. The EMT plate is
a very nice reverb, and there’s an AMS reverb, which is this one that I use in
everything.
Benji B
They’re not small, though, are they?
Floating Points 
The EMT plate, yeah. The thing is, you can get them relatively cheap, it’s
just because no one’s got space for them. But, yeah, don’t try and lift it by
yourself.
Audience Member 
Is this thing on? Hello? Okay. I’m just riffing off of Cary’s question, I find
it interesting, too. I come from an approach that’s more like a social
approach to music, I want to relate on an emotional level. And I feel like
when you just began talking about your doctorate, PhD, it evoked this sense of
synesthesia in me. That’s what I connected to most, because that’s the
physicality and the way the brain relates to physicality, is how I think about
music. Like a shiver going over your shoulder, and then being distracted by
your heart dipping lower when a certain thing happens in the music. I’m
interested in hearing about how it makes you feel, why you do music, like... The
emotional side, rather than what you use, you know?
Floating Points 
Right, okay.
Audience Member 
And whether you’d ever investigate that on an academic level.
Floating Points 
I do feel something when I make music...
Audience Member 
Oh, yeah.
Floating Points 
Sorry, I don’t quite understand. Obviously, it’s much easier for me to answer
those more technical things, and maybe me saying that making music was the
sort of sense of release from doing daily science work was a little over-
simplification. I need to make music to be happy.
Audience Member 
It’s very evident in your music, that’s why I’m asking. Because it’s like the
poeticism of your science is so beautiful, when I listen your songs.
Floating Points 
Say it again?
Audience Member 
It’s poetic, the science related to listening to your songs. It’s interesting
that you don’t connect it.
Floating Points 
Yeah. No, I don’t. [laughs]
Audience Member 
It’s more of a discussion point than a question.
Floating Points 
Right, I think you’ve thought about this more than I have actually. [laughs]
Audience Member 
Say something!
Audience Member 
Yeah.
Benji B
Any more questions? Going, going... All right. Thank you very much, Dr.
Floating Points.
[applause]
Floating Points 
Thank you.

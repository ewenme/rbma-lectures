Arturo Lanz abandoned a career in pop music for one in uncompromising industrial – or repetitive meditation music, as he would put it – as Esplendor Geométrico in the early years of post-Franco Spain. Looking to Throbbing Gristle and Cabaret Voltaire, he forged a sound that his compatriots didn’t get, but which made him something of a cult figure decades later, when a track was revived for the Minimal Wave Vol. 1 compilation. Now living and working in Beijing, he divides his free time between running, cycling and music. Not that he ever listens to his own stuff – or even names or edits it, all tasks he leaves to other people. 
In his 2011 Red Bull Music Academy lecture, Lanz discusses the influence of Throbbing Gristle, the ’80s music scene in Madrid, his cavalier approach to releasing music, and more. 
Emma Warren 
But we have with us a man who’s been hugely important in industrial music and the music
he’s made with his band Esplendor Geométrico – sorry, I’m going to have to apologize
throughout for a very poor Spanish pronunciation – has been massively
influential on music that you would expect, but also on music that you wouldn’t
expect. We’re gonna be hearing some of the music he’s been making recently,
because this is someone with a creative lifespan that spans many decades. When you think abou it, most
people have a purple patch, a period when they’re creative and making stuff. But usually that period is fairly finite. I think you can say, accurately with
this band, they’ve remained creatively interesting, strong, confrontational
and powerful, throughout a long time. So I’d like to say a very, very big
welcome to Arturo Lanz. [applause]
Arturo Lanz 
Thank you, thank you.
Emma Warren 
We’re going to get some context later on and find out about Madrid in 1980 and
the context that made you make music. But before that I’d like to hear some of
the new music you’ve made. You’ve got an album that came out, was it yesterday?
Arturo Lanz 
Two days ago.
Emma Warren 
OK, two days ago. So we’re talking something brand spanking new. Do you want to tell us a bit
about the new record before we hear anything?
Arturo Lanz 
It’s the music I make in my home at night, trying to meditate with my music.
This is the purpose of my music, something for myself and for meditation in
the evening. I have friends and they consider that it is possible to publish.
This is my career; there are no more secrets.
Emma Warren 
I have to admit that I haven’t heard this album, but the music that I have heard of yours that you did
from 1981 up to the mid-’80s and the early ’90s is not what I would call meditation music. [laughter]
You extract tones from machines, you scream, you shout. This is powerful stuff.
Arturo Lanz 
They are very repetitive.
Emma Warren 
So this meditation music, is it a radical departure for you? Are you making dolphin music?
Arturo Lanz 
No, no, no, it’s not like that. It’s something like a mantra. Maybe for the rest of the people it’s a crazy idea, but for me it’s like this.
Emma Warren 
So for you it’s like this. What’s the track you’re going to play us?
Arturo Lanz 
I don’t know, the first one.
(music: Esplendor Geométrico — “Puntos De Centrado” / applause)
Emma Warren 
So we have meditation industrial-style there. There’s something I’m very interested in here. When you think about industrial music you think about being bludgeoned with something. You think about machines. You don’t think about funk in a natural sense, but somehow your music has a lot of groove in it. How do you find a groove when your source material is industrial sounds and machine music and aggressive sounds like that?
Arturo Lanz 
When I am in my home and start to do this I don’t consider this is industrial. It’s the
people who call it industrial. At the beginning with Throbbing Gristle and
Cabaret Voltaire... Well, I consider industrial music only Throbbing Gristle.
The rest of the groups, for instance, Esplendor Geométrico, I don’t think it’s
industrial. It’s more repetitive music, something non-industrial. Maybe dance
music.
Emma Warren 
So not industrial, but repetitive music definitely. So, for you, where’s the
groove in repetitive music?
Arturo Lanz 
The groove? What is groove? [laughs]
Emma Warren 
[laughs] OK, perhaps we started in slightly too complicated a fashion.
Certainly, for me today, I’m going to keep things simple. Tell me about the
beginning. You started making music in 1980 in Madrid, so obviously this is a
time of great political change and also a period where people were reacting to
the years of dictatorship. Can you give us a sense of what it was like to be
young and creative at that point, and what you were responding to?
Arturo Lanz 
Well, I was 16 years old in 1977 and we started in ’77, ’78 with a group called
El Aviador Dro, which was techno-pop music. More pop than techno.
Emma Warren 
So this is your first band, 1980?
Arturo Lanz 
Yeah. In 1980 in Madrid, the ambience in Madrid was very [creative] with
Almodovar and so on making
short films, and there was a free movement after Franco. The people wanted to
do something and around this time I heard the Sex Pistols and realized it’s
very easy for you do something with music while not having any idea about
music. And we started doing this until ’80; then I started Esplendor Geométrico.
Emma Warren 
So before 1980 you’re in your band, you’re inspired by the Sex Pistols, and you realize you can
make music. Again, some people may have an idea of what life was like in Spain
under Franco, to other people it may not be so clear. Can you give us a sense
of what it’s like to live under his regime? Was he very controlling of music
and culture? Is this something that affected everybody on an everyday level?
Arturo Lanz 
I was very young and when I realized I lived under the Franco regime it was
almost at an end of the situation. I didn’t realize that I lived in a
dictatorship.
Emma Warren 
So it wasn’t impacting on you personally?
Arturo Lanz 
Yes, by ’76 I realized that before that there had been no freedom at all. My
family explained to me that it was terrible. People had had it up to here of
this situation. Now that I live in Beijing, it’s the same feeling. I think it’s very
similar to these years in Madrid.
Emma Warren 
I want to ask you about Beijing and your observations of that city, but for
the moment we should get back to the beginnings of your musical career. You’re
in this band, El Aviador. You’re making music that’s somewhere around the
Kraftwerk kind of area?
Arturo Lanz 
No, no.
Emma Warren 
Not at all? This internet is full of lies, man. Don’t believe anything you
read online. So you tell me what was the music like of that band.
Arturo Lanz 
It’s pop, but we have some futuristic costumes. We were like
Devo, we were a total copy because in Spain it was like this.
Emma Warren 
But actually, that’s an interesting thing, isn’t it? Often, the way people start creatively
is to take something they like and to do it themselves but to do it slightly wrong.
Either that can be the beginning of your own creative path, or you can create
your own sound as a reaction to the thing you do wrong. Would you say that was
the case for you?
Arturo Lanz 
Yes, it was copying this and I was the voice in the group, I didn’t make any
music. In the ’80s I realized it was bullshit, terrible. I heard something
more interesting and started to do something more vital for me.
Emma Warren 
So you say you heard something more interesting and wanted to do something
more vital. What was it you heard that made you stop making music like Devo in
costumes and do something more vital?
Arturo Lanz 
Throbbing Gristle. They were the first group that made me say, “OK, this is incredible.”
Emma Warren 
How did you first come across Throbbing Gristle? Do you recall how it felt
when you first heard their music? Maybe you have something to play.
Arturo Lanz 
By Throbbing Gristle?
Emma Warren 
Yes.
Arturo Lanz 
Yeah, yeah. But I have something new.
Emma Warren 
Tell us then about your early interactions with this band, when you first
heard them.
Arturo Lanz 
Throbbing Gristle? I was in Switzerland, in Zürich, and I was in a record
shop. The people in the shop were very nice and, “This is very good. If you’re
looking for something different, you have to have this.” Then – and this is
very important in music and in life – I was lucky that this man in the record
shop was very interested to show me something new.
Emma Warren 
So a random interaction in a Swiss record shop and suddenly Throbbing Gristle
enter your life. That’s a powerful set of people to have in your household.
Arturo Lanz 
Then we started doing something more special. At the beginning it was pop;
Esplendor Geométrico was a little pop. I can put something of this on. This is
“Moscú Está Halado.” Do you have “Moscú”?
Emma Warren 
“Moscú”? Yes. See if you can find it; let’s have a race. I think you’re gonna win. So this is the track that was reissued on the Stones Throw label recently, Minimal Wave Vol. 1, where they collected music that had been influential, early electronic repetitive industrial world. And through that a whole load of other people found out about your music.
Arturo Lanz 
We can play this. In this time it was very innocent music. About ’79.
(music: Esplendor Geométrico — “Moscú Está Helado”)
(music: Esplendor Geométrico — “Necrosis En La Poya” / applause)
I consider this the first song by Esplendor Geométrico.
Emma Warren 
Is this one of the ones released on cassette?
Arturo Lanz 
No, it was a single.
Emma Warren 
So you did it as a 7”.
Arturo Lanz 
Yeah.
Emma Warren 
But you also released some cassettes, didn’t you? These were things you did
yourself?
Arturo Lanz 
Yes, after this record we did the first cassette.
Emma Warren 
So how important was it for you to be in control of your own material, both
financially, in terms of the structure, and also creative freedom?
Arturo Lanz 
There was no other way in Spain at this time. This kind of music was
impossible, even to play live it was impossible. And people in Spain didn’t understand anything about this music.
Emma Warren 
So why was it impossible to play? Because no one wanted to come and see you?
Or was it considered too controversial?
Arturo Lanz 
Yeah, very controversial, and also everyone thought I was crazy. This was in the ’80s
and people in Spain were focused on pop, and to be happy and to be fun. If you do
something that isn’t fun then you are from another planet. People don’t speak
to you, they say, “This is crazy.”
Emma Warren 
So why was it so controversial? Just because it was music that people had never experienced before or you were covering things and using images and ideas that were quite shocking?
Arturo Lanz 
We were against this and we were against these people. The words of the songs
were a little heavy. Nowadays, in Spain I think it’s impossible to use these
kinds of words for the songs. We’d be in jail.
Emma Warren 
So you think you’d be imprisoned if you made music now like you made in the
’80s.
Arturo Lanz 
With these words, yeah.
Emma Warren 
How do you feel about that now? Are there things that you regret or do you
believe that an artist should never censor themself no matter how offensive other people might find it?
Arturo Lanz 
Now I don’t do anything about this. I don’t need to. But at this age, 16 years old, yeah. We need to do something in Spain like this.
Emma Warren 
You talk about yourself being 16 years old, so is that the impulse of that point in your life or is it the impulse of someone coming out of a country in dictatorship?
Arturo Lanz 
It’s a reaction against some people who think music is only joy and funny. For
me at this time, it was not like this.
Emma Warren 
So you wanted to make some music that was not joyful and not funny. Can you
tell us a bit more about how that showed itself or maybe play us some other
music which kind of fits into this category?
Arturo Lanz 
For example, this one.
(music: Esplendor Geométrico — unknown / applause)
Emma Warren 
You’ve kind of already answered this but I have to ask you this again after
hearing that record, where do you stand on censorship generally for an artist?
Should artists ever censor themselves or should an artist always feel free to
make the music they feel regardless of potential offense to other people?
Arturo Lanz 
Can you repeat, please? [laughs]
Emma Warren 
Do you think artists should censor themselves? What’s more important – my right
to say what I want or your right not to be offended?
Arturo Lanz 
Now, I think it’s very important don’t offend the people. I think that’s the most
important. Enjoy your music but try not to offend anyone.
Emma Warren 
Does that just come down to words, to lyrics? Obviously, before you were writing words, there’s still a vocal
element to what you’re doing. But I understand you tend to use words you find,
found material, newspaper headlines. Words you like rather than lyrics that
mean something. You’ve said you don’t want to offend people. Musically, you
still want to be strong and powerful and confrontational, but you no longer
want to use words that other people would find offensive. Is there a
difference between words and music in terms of their power?
Arturo Lanz 
No, because with music it’s impossible to offend anyone. I do it for myself.
I don’t do it for anyone. I don’t think I offend anyone, only me. If I don’t
like it then I’m offended by my music. But the rest of the people, if they don’t
like it then don’t listen to this music. It’s very easy. But with words it’s
different, because the words, the people can suffer with what you say and I don’t want the people to suffer.
Emma Warren 
Let’s talk for a minute about the equipment you’re using to make these
records. You’re coming from a band that was more kind of pop-centred. You started the band with two other people, and I understand you picked up a Korg and a four-track recorder. So what was it, an MS-20?
Arturo Lanz 
MS-20, yeah, and an echo very primitive, and delay. And, of course, there’s no Logic. At this time it doesn’t exist. One record for two tracks.
Emma Warren 
So a two-track recorder.
Arturo Lanz
MS-20 and MS-10.
Emma Warren 
So were these machines easy to get at that point or were they still quite rare
or expensive?
Arturo Lanz 
Two members of Esplendor Geométrico sold their guitars and bass and bought the
synthesizers.
Emma Warren 
So they sold their guitar and their bass for their synths, a transaction which
other people would recognize. Were you aware of other people making machine
music? Were you aware of others or did you feel like only you were doing this?
Arturo Lanz 
In Spain no one else was doing this music.
Emma Warren 
I guess, I’m interested in knowing who you considered to be your peers. Who
was making music similar to you?
Arturo Lanz 
Cabaret Voltaire and Throbbing Gristle and at the same time there’s
SPK from Australia. We had
friendly relations with SPK.
Emma Warren 
What did the Korg and the two-track recorder give you that the guitars and the
drums couldn’t give you before? What was the difference working with the Korg,
a machine, and the instruments?
Arturo Lanz 
It was much easier. You can do it at home with earphones, very easy. The
guitars and the drums in your room at home, this is awful. You have to be a
local to stay there. In my room it was impossible, my family hated this music.
I can’t use earphones with the guitar.
Emma Warren 
So did your family enjoy your music more once you moved to the Korg?
Arturo Lanz 
No, no, no. [laughter] They’re happy for me because I’m happy, but the music for my family is not very serious.
Emma Warren 
One other thing about this particular period in time... You took your name from an Italian
futurist. Was it common at that time to be inspired by politics and radical
philosophy? I think now if you talked to musicians and say, “Are you inspired
by politics and radical philosophy?” – most people would say no. I could be
wrong, but I think generally people feel politics and music should be
separate. Quite often they are quite separate, and there aren’t many people
working in a way that’s naturally cohesive between the two. So was this a normal thing to do at the time?
Arturo Lanz 
Well, yes. The name was very nice in Spanish. Esplendor Geométrico sounds very good. And
we were reading a lot of futurist philosophy books. El Aviador is the name of
a futurist opera and Esplendor Geométrico is a poem by
[Filippo Tommaso] Marinetti. There’s
nothing behind this though, it’s only the name because we thought it
was beautiful. It’s nothing intellectual.
Emma Warren 
So for you it was just that you liked the sound of the words.
Arturo Lanz 
Yes. It’s like with the CDs, the names of the tracks, there’s nothing behind
it. I don’t choose the names, it’s other people. For me, it’s not interesting
to choose the names.
Emma Warren 
Is that because you want the listeners to have the freedom to take what they
want from it?
Arturo Lanz 
Yes, even for me.
Emma Warren 
It’s interesting because at the same time people from Detroit, people like
Juan Atkins who went on to make
Detroit techno, were listening to music that overlapped with the music you
were listening to and were interested in futuristic texts. For them, I guess,
it was more Alvin Toffler than
Marinetti or the people you were listening to, but it does seem across the
world at that time there were people having the same idea who were expressing
it differently. I guess the Detroit guys were taking the industrial sounds of
their city and it sounded like techno; you were taking the sounds of your city
and making it sound different. Point over. [laughs] 
OK, we’ve talked about
some of the first pieces of music you made, but you carried on making tens of
albums. I think you made three, four, five albums in the ’80s. Was it four?
Arturo Lanz 
I don’t know.
Emma Warren 
Loads. Anyway. But there was one album in 1988, Mekano-Turbo, which seemed to have another turning point with some
other influences coming in. Do you have some music from that album with you?
Arturo Lanz 
No.
Emma Warren 
If not that one, perhaps there’s music from another album in the ’80s that
you’d care to share with us. ’Cause this is a point, you had started your
label, Esplendor Geométrico Discos, in 1985, I guess partly because you had to, but also because you had this creative
freedom.
Arturo Lanz 
I don’t know if I have it here. I don’t listen to my music. I never listen to
my music.
Emma Warren 
I guess some of us will be listening to your music when you play.
Arturo Lanz 
Yeah, I like to hear my music live. Because it’s the only opportunity I have
to have a lot of sound, a lot of power.
Emma Warren 
I guess anyone who’s seen YouTube clips of you performing will know there’s a
lot of energy and power in your performance. I mean, really.
Arturo Lanz 
This last CD, maybe after one week I’m not going to listen to it again.
Because it’s very boring for me.
Emma Warren 
What will you be performing when we see you play?
Arturo Lanz 
From this last one ‘cause it’s the most enjoyable, because the old one is
terrible, you know? Very boring. [laughs]
Emma Warren 
I guess this is obvious, but when you’ve been making music a long time and
people are interested in a certain period of your music, how do you keep pushing forwards? How do
you keep the creative power when probably people just want to listen back to
the old stuff ‘cause it’s easier now?
Arturo Lanz 
Because I don’t think about people when I make music. This “Moscú Está Halado”
that was on the compilation is terrible for me now, I don’t like it. I don’t
consider this my music anymore. I don’t recognize me in the music I did in the
past. Always in the new, because the past is past. There’s only the present.
Emma Warren 
So you’re a true modernist in that
sense, always having to do the music you’re doing now. Let’s stick with the
live performance, because I’ve seen clips of you onstage. You’re banging things,
you’re storming around the stage. You’re very present on the stage, pretending to hang
yourself. You’ve got your microphone in your mouth. It’s a very strong way of
performing, specifically the thing to do with the microphone. Actually swallowing
the microphone and performing with it. So you don’t need any hands, you’re
holding it in your mouth. How did you start doing that?
Arturo Lanz 
It’s natural. [laughs] It’s nothing I studied, it’s in the state. During the
state, similar to a mantra or something, then you can do this. Even I a gym, I did
exercise in Germany in one concert. The power of the sound is very repetitive and you start to be very physical. It’s very physical, this music. 
Emma Warren 
It really is. When we first started talking I asked you about a groove and
it’s not necessarily a groove, but it’s something you can’t help moving to.
There’s a physical response to the music, which is quite powerful. For you as
a performer, do you feel you’re just doing what your body is telling you to do
in the moment of that music? I guess, it’s the opposite of a dance routine. You’re following where your body is taking you in response to the sound.
Arturo Lanz 
The second one.
Emma Warren 
It looks like that. It looks like you’re in a very primal state that you’re in as a
performer.
Arturo Lanz 
It depends on the sound of the state. If the sound is good and powerful, then
it’s very, very good for me. If the sound isn’t good then the concert is very
relaxed.
Emma Warren 
Then we’ll see you in your chair, pressing a few button. Maybe doing a few
formation dance routines.
Arturo Lanz 
Yeah, it’s very physical. It’s not with a laptop – maybe it’s broken by
the end of the concert. You have to consider this, also. Sometimes I broke the
thing. But not with the poses, there’s nothing prepared. You know? It’s natural.
Emma Warren 
So what kinds of things have got broken recently?
Arturo Lanz 
It’s terrible. One Wavestation. Of Korg. This incredible instrument, and I broke it, it’s terrible.
Emma Warren 
How did you break it? Was it just in the moment?
Arturo Lanz 
In Japan, with percussion. [laughter] And then totally broken. But it’s awful ’cause it makes no sense to break it. [shrugs]
Emma Warren 
One thing that occurred to me from seeing your performances is that actually a
lot of laptop performers could learn something from you. Whether or not they
choose to trash their equipment, that’s another thing. But certainly, I’ve not
often seen laptop performers who are able to own the stage or move away
from the laptop. You’ve got controllers. Saverio was using a controller and
you were using one in your performance, moving away from the laptop and
controlling it remotely. It’ll be interesting to see how this generation of
laptop performers start to develop performances that enable them to step away
from the machine and interact with the crowd.
Arturo Lanz 
In our case, Saverio Evangelista is a member of
the group, who is more relaxed and controls the things. But I think things
like Alva Noto is more visual. They play with the visuals, which is
good, but is not my case. We have visuals, but it’s because Saverio likes them
a lot. For me, it’s not important, it’s only the music.
Emma Warren 
Not visuals, just the music. Do you have something else you can play us?
Arturo Lanz 
More music. [loud crash / laughter]
Emma Warren 
Wakey wakey! That was the whole track? [laughter] Joke.
(music: Esplendor Geométrico — unknown / applause)
Arturo Lanz 
A lot of the voices I use come from YouTube. This is like a woman screaming.
Emma Warren 
Why do you think aggression is such a powerful emotion in your music?
Arturo Lanz 
Aggression? No, I don’t think it’s aggressive.
Emma Warren 
What do you think it is?
Arturo Lanz 
Aggressive? No, no.
Emma Warren 
Maybe confrontational? Maybe disturbing? What would you say?
Arturo Lanz 
I think it’s nice. [laughter] It’s a work for the peace of the world. [laughs]
Emma Warren 
It really does show how a different set of ears, a different cultural
influence will interpret music differently.
Arturo Lanz 
With this music you can listen with earphones, very loud. You have to realize
every sound of the track is like something for which you must have an empty
mind. Then you can use yourself to jump. But it’s not aggressive. I don’t feel
it’s aggressive. Maybe I’m wrong.
Emma Warren 
That’s one of the beauties of making music, especially something that’s quite
unique, is that it’s going to be accepted differently by different people.
Nobody’s ears hear in exactly the same way, we all perceive things
differently.
Arturo Lanz 
Of course. Plenty of people feel it’s aggressive. But for me, no.
Emma Warren 
Of course. You referred again to this kind of meditative aspect of the music,
so if you put your headphones on and get into it somehow it’ll empty your
mind, it’ll allow you to reach a state of... what?
Arturo Lanz 
An empty mind. It’s very easy with this to have an empty mind.
Emma Warren 
Are you interested in meditation generally outside of music?
Arturo Lanz 
Yes, very interested.
Emma Warren 
Is it something you practise?
Arturo Lanz 
Yeah, I practise meditation.
Emma Warren 
Does it help you with the music?
Arturo Lanz 
No, not really. But my life is also music, and it’s for my life and my music
and the other things that I do. Of course, I’d recommend this to anyone, these
meditation techniques. Very nice.
Emma Warren 
Maybe if you were to offer some tips, some thoughts, to people on how to make
your whole life creative instead of just a portion, meditation would be one
part of that.
Arturo Lanz 
Yes, it’s very creative. Even when you meditate you create things.
Emma Warren 
Anything else you would suggest in order to have a creative life?
Arturo Lanz 
Don’t give any importance to the music. [laughs] I don’t give any importance
to what I do. I think that’s the most important thing. And, of course, it’s
very important for creativity – don’t look for money, for example. Don’t look
to people buying your records. I think this is a very anti-creative thing.
Emma Warren 
So you’re saying, to be creative you need to not attach too much importance to
your music?
Arturo Lanz 
Important for you but not for the rest of the people. Maybe other people don’t
like it. So it’s important for you, but not for the rest of the people. You
have to realize this or you are going to suffer a lot. I do a lot of other
things; music is ten percent of my life.
Emma Warren 
So are you saying if you’re making music you have to make it for yourself and
that’s it?
Arturo Lanz 
Yes.
Emma Warren 
I mean, I know it’s kind of obvious – that’s what everything creative comes down to;
you make it for yourself and if other people like it that’s a bonus. But
sometimes it can get quite complicated, can’t it? If you’re making music and it becomes
your business, it can be hard not to feed the business and make the
music that the business itself requires.
Arturo Lanz 
This is the question. For me, it’s impossible to live with this kind of music.
But I like it. So I have to work on another thing if not. If I have no money
then it’s impossible to make the music. Then I have to work on another thing.
Emma Warren 
Can you imagine not making music?
Arturo Lanz 
No, it’s impossible. After 40 years, 35 years, it’s impossible.
Emma Warren 
How often do you work?
Arturo Lanz 
Every day, every evening.
Emma Warren 
So is it a routine? Maybe after dinner you sit there and make music for two
hours or what?
Arturo Lanz 
Yes, it’s a routine. I use a Mac and now – because before it was impossible – I use Logic and this rhythm machine,
Ultrabeat – I think that’s the name, I don’t know – and it’s a very nice rhythm machine.
You can do a lot of rhythms, very repetitive. If I can stand 20 or 30 minutes of the same, then I consider that’s good. If ten minutes, it starts being boring...
Emma Warren 
So you mean that if you can listen to a piece of music you’re making for 20 minutes…
Arturo Lanz 
More than 20, maybe 30.
Emma Warren 
Then you’ll continue making it. If after ten minutes you’re bored, you’ll dash
it.
Arturo Lanz 
Yes. If it’s boring I won’t finish it.
Emma Warren 
Interesting, this is a very fast work rate. How long does it take you to make
a track?
Arturo Lanz 
Very difficult to say. If after 30 minutes you say it’s okay, then this is the
base of the track. Then I go to YouTube, I put in sounds with synthesizers
that are okay with the rhythm. And I try not to put more the day after.
Emma Warren 
So you’ll leave it. You make the track, go to YouTube, get some sounds, put them on the track. Then once you’ve placed stuff, are you doing anything more to it or are you just saying, that’s it, it’s done?
Arturo Lanz 
That’s it, enough. At the beginning, when I was using the MS-20, the MS-10,
these analog instruments, it was impossible to record, impossible to repeat
the same track. I tried to do the same with the digital, the computer.
Emma Warren 
So you’re taking an analog working practice to a digital environment.
Arturo Lanz 
Yes.
Emma Warren 
Does that work for you because that’s how you used to work? Or does it work
for you because you think there’s a kind of power to things being raw and
unfinished?
Arturo Lanz 
If you start to think or put more things in there, then it makes no sense.
It’s not fresh. This way it’s more natural. Then the next day you have another
track.
Emma Warren 
One thing I think people here might struggle with is to know when a track is
finished. The temptation is to keep working on it and make it perfect and find
this point where it’s done. Your solution is very simple: If you’re bored, it’s no good, and if you can live with it for 20
minutes it’s done. Do you have any suggestions here for how people might know
when a track is finished and to have the confidence to then step away and move
on to something new?
Arturo Lanz 
It’s impossible to give some advice to people because, of course, they will
know more than me with computers and music. Everyone has their way of working
and I think all of them are okay.
Emma Warren 
But do you, perhaps, think part of the reason you’ve produced so much music and
released so much music every decade since your first releases in 1981
is because you know how to finish a track?
Arturo Lanz 
Yeah, maybe that’s the reason. [laughs]
Emma Warren 
I know some brilliant musicians who’ve hardly put out any music because
they’re never content.
Arturo Lanz 
Perfection is a terrible thing. I don’t look for perfection; no matter about
perfect things. Better not to be perfect.
Emma Warren 
I think for some musicians, the quest for perfectionism can be a real curse. Moving on to something
else, you live in Beijing. Some people here might know about the music and culture
you’ll find in that city but I don’t. Can you tell us what attracted you to
live there and what it’s like musically and culturally in that city?
Arturo Lanz 
I live there because I work there in the embassy of Spain. It’s a very
interesting city. I’ve been there 15 years, people are nice, and now the music is
starting to be... it’s like in Spain in the ’80s. There’s a lot of groups doing
pop and techno and noise. I think in two or three or four years there’s going
to be a lot of interesting people there.
Emma Warren 
It’s interesting, again I might be wrong here, because my understanding is
that in Brazil, the tropicália music, which is very beautiful music, was a
reaction to a totalitarian government. It was very subtly against the
government. You could make points, you could speak to people, but you did it
in a very beautiful way. Do you think there’s a point where a totalitarian
government is changing and that’s the point where people want to make music
that’s more powerful?
Arturo Lanz 
No, I think the people making music there aren’t thinking about the change of
government. It’s very free... If you don’t say that the Communist Party is awful, then you can
do what you want. People are not interested in general. Maybe in five or six
years the middle class is going to be more important. The Communist Party is
preparing to change now. I don’t think it’s going to be very violent.
Emma Warren 
So what kind of music have you come across while in Beijing? Are there any
artists or bands you’ve seen perform that you thought were particularly
interesting?
Arturo Lanz 
Well, there is a band, I don’t know if it exist over here, it’s called White.
Two Chinese people, one girl and one man and it’s very interesting music. And
that’s with an MS-20.
Emma Warren 
The wheel has come full circle.
Arturo Lanz 
Yeah, yeah. Then there are people who are extremely noisy, like in Japan, but
even more than Japanese people. Because Chinese people are more radical than
Japanese. Then there are a lot of techno DJs. Some of the best places to go
for DJs are Shanghai and Beijing. It’s a very good market for them.
Emma Warren 
It’s a fully global world, so of course, it’s perfectly natural that young kids in
China will be listening to the same music that we’re all listening to here.
Arturo Lanz 
It was impossible to listen to The Beatles, but now it’s possible. Even if the
social networks are [down] and it’s impossible to go to Facebook or YouTube,
the people have this
VPN.
Emma Warren 
So it’s not officially possible to go to Facebook or YouTube but there’s
ways of accessing the music. There was one interesting thing, which kind of semi-taps into this,
that I heard you say was you make folk music but with electronic instruments.
For instance, in the UK, some people believe that grime music is folk music. But
instead of being an old Irish guy in a pub with a violin, you’re a young guy
from the streets of East London with a microphone. Is that an accurate quote?
Do you believe you’re making folk music?
Arturo Lanz 
It’s more tribal music than folk. It’s not technological music, it’s more
physical. I think it’s very primitive music. If I could do the same with my body and
not use instruments, I think it’s better, but it’s impossible.
Emma Warren 
We’re gonna put it out to questions fairly soon. I guess, you’re saying it’s
primal and physical rather than folk music. Maybe folk is something that
reflects the feelings of the people and tribal music is maybe less conscious. But
are you aware of the influence that your music has had on musicians who are
operating now?
Arturo Lanz 
No.
Emma Warren 
Is that because you’re not interested in perhaps seeing yourself like that?
Arturo Lanz 
No, I’m not interested. I’m not a myth man. I don’t believe in myths. People
say it’s a cool band. For me I don’t believe this. People say everyone had their
influence. But it’s not important who you influence.
Emma Warren 
So I guess what you’re saying is you don’t believe in a mythology of self, a
mythology of you. You just see yourself as real.
Arturo Lanz 
Yeah, yeah.
Emma Warren 
Interesting. That’s quite strong. It’s very easy to get caught up in an idea of
what people think of you, rather than what you think of yourself.
Arturo Lanz 
I don’t care what people think about me.
Emma Warren 
That’s a precondition for creativity perhaps. So, perhaps we should hear
another piece of music. Then we should see what you guys would like to ask.
(music: Esplendor Geométrico — unknown / applause)
I definitely got that zoning-out thing there. Judging by everyone else there I
think quite a few people did too. So, questions. Can we get the radio mic out? Who’s going first?
Audience Member 
You said you live in Beijing now. Did that change your music in any way?
Arturo Lanz 
Not really. Maybe yes without me realising. There’s no influence from the
place you live, I think.
Emma Warren 
This is an interesting thing, actually. I’ve heard you say you’re not really influenced by anything. Is that the way you prefer to operate, to not really recognize
influences, and instead just to do it less consciously?
Arturo Lanz 
Maybe I’m influenced but I don’t realize. But no, I don’t think living in
Beijing… it’s influencing my life, of course, but I think in Madrid maybe I’d do the same music. It’s not important, the place. It’s inner space.
Emma Warren 
OK, so you make music from an inner space rather than an external space. But do
cities sound different? Does Beijing sound different from Madrid?
Arturo Lanz 
Yes, of course. They sound very, very different.
Emma Warren 
Can you describe the difference?
Arturo Lanz 
The sound in Beijing, you can listen to the sound of the people 24 hours a
day. The scream, the traffic. You have not any place, only in your home that’s quiet.
There’s a lot of noise. Madrid, no, but Beijing is different. In Madrid you
can go to place where nobody else is there. But in China, Beijing, it’s
impossible.
Emma Warren 
I’ve noticed in Madrid a lot of bird song. A lot of bird song in the city. You
don’t have too much of that in central London. Lots of pigeons.
Arturo Lanz 
The pigeons are totally dead from the pollution.
Emma Warren 
The pigeons seem to be the only things that survived in London. Everything
else is gone.
Arturo Lanz 
In Beijing, 75 percent of the days, it would be impossible to go out in Europe.
75 percent of the days in Beijing you would have to stay at home in Europe.
Emma Warren 
You can’t go in the streets?
Arturo Lanz 
It’s impossible because of the pollution. With this level of pollution in
Madrid, they’d close the streets.
Emma Warren 
Seventy-five percent of days. So how do you get to work?
Arturo Lanz 
[shrugs] The people are very strong there. [laughter]
Emma Warren 
The Chinese constitution wins out. Another question.
Audience Member 
It seems like you make a lot of music, you were saying you make it every day. Do you pick what you want to put out? You have so much to choose from. Do you kinda see what
works together? I’m curious how you pick what will go on the record.
Arturo Lanz 
It’s not me, it’s my friends. I send the tracks to them and then they choose
the tracks that are best for them.
Audience Member 
Do you send them everything or a favorite?
Arturo Lanz 
Everything.
Audience Member 
So how much is everything?
Arturo Lanz 
Everything I like; everything I like. Anything where I can stand 20 or 30
minutes with this music. Then I send it to them, they put the name of the
track and they choose the best.
Audience Member 
Do they pick the art as well?
Arturo Lanz 
Yes.
Audience Member 
Must be good friends. [laughter]
Emma Warren 
It’s a very different way of working, isn’t it, to just literally strip out
every other element — the naming of the tracks, the artwork, the selection of
the tracks — all of that you’re not interested in, just the sound.
Arturo Lanz 
Yes.
Emma Warren 
Wow. I don’t think I’ve come across anyone else who works in the same way.
Usually, artists are involved in the other side of it. I think it’s
fascinating.
Arturo Lanz 
I’m not interested in that, only in the moment I do the music. The rest is not
important. If it were not for the people who compile the CD, all the CDs, if
not for them I wouldn’t have any music in the market. Because I don’t need to do this. [holding CD]
Emma Warren 
How does it feel when you get that back? To you, your music is tens of tracks,
20s of tracks, 100s of tracks on your computer. You send stuff off
and it comes back like this with track names and selection. How do you feel
about your music when you see it represented to you like this?
Arturo Lanz 
Sometimes I say [looks at CD] “What is the track ’Presíon’?” I don’t know.
“Cada Día Más”? [shrugs] “Luz De Socorro”? I have no idea. But it’s OK because it’s very
good for the ego. To [bring] down the ego, you know? And you know, the photos are nice. [laughter / applause]
Emma Warren 
You might not be a perfectionist but you are absolutely a purist. Next question.
Audience Member 
How long normally does a track have? How many minutes? Do you think about
that?
Arturo Lanz 
No, I don’t think about it because this CD, one track is five minutes 45, but maybe it’s
12 minutes. The people cut.
Audience Member 
You don’t think about arrangement? Just bounce 30 minutes of music, send it to
them and they just cut the part they like?
Arturo Lanz 
Yes.
Audience Member 
And when you are searching for samples on YouTube, you search them randomly?
Arturo Lanz 
Yes.
Audience Member 
You don’t have a subject? Are you just seeing random YouTube videos and
saying, “OK, I like this, I like this”?
Arturo Lanz 
No, for example, I’ll look for “woman screaming.” Or “Japanese speeches.” And
then this is okay for this track. If not this track, maybe another one. Any
track where you can put the voices that you find on YouTube that’s very nice in the
sound.
Audience Member 
You only search for voices on YouTube?
Arturo Lanz 
Yes.
Audience Member 
Normally your tracks, you don’t know how many minutes you...
Arturo Lanz 
No, because I sample them with a sampler. I use YouTube, then I put in the
sampler and then I repeat.
Audience Member 
And the final track, when you send to the people, how many minutes?
Arturo Lanz 
It depends, around 12, 13, 20.
Audience Member 
They just cut whatever they want?
Arturo Lanz 
[nods] And another thing is, I do a track, then I cut a wave of the track
myself, then I put in a loop, then I repeat for another 40 minutes. Then it’s
20 minutes and I choose one very short loop in the wave and then I repeat again.
This is very repetitive because it’s a repetition of the repetition. It’s very
good.
Emma Warren 
So this will be the basis of a new track?
Arturo Lanz 
Yes.
Audience Member 
You said you work in an embassy in Beijing. How do you manage that dual life,
to make the music work and the work in the embassy, put it all together and
still be as energetic as you are?
Arturo Lanz 
I have to work and my position in the embassy is like a diplomat. My work is
there very silly work, it’s not very difficult. Then two Sundays ago I did a
marathon ’cause I like to run, I like to bike. Sixty percent of my life is
running and the bike, ten percent is music. The rest is staying in the
office and with my children. But now the most important thing is running.
Emma Warren 
But running is also very meditative, isn’t it? Talking about running a
marathon, when you’re running with other people, something happens to heart
rate and blood pressure where you can synchronise with other people.
Arturo Lanz 
Right now every day I run around 15km.
Emma Warren 
Wow. You don’t mess about, do you? [laughter]
Arturo Lanz 
And it’s very good for music, very repetitive. The rhythm of the breath is
like a concert.
Emma Warren 
Do you mean the sound of yourself running is like music to you? Or does it
help you make music when you get home?
Arturo Lanz 
Yeah. It’s better when you don’t think when you’re running, only listening to your
breath.
Audience Member
Do you listen to anything when you’re running?
Arturo Lanz 
No.
Audience Member 
You’re talking about repetitive music. Do you try to go to some other time
signatures rather than just 4/4 or eight-beat? Do you go five beats or seven
beats?
Arturo Lanz 
No, I don’t think about it. You are from...?
Audience Member 
India.
Arturo Lanz 
Now, I like a lot of Indian music, for example. I hear a lot of this kind of
thing. Can I...?
(music: unknown)
Audience Member 
This is the mantra of the nation.
Arturo Lanz 
This is 22 minutes and for me it’s perfect, this kind of thing, very
repetitive. Now this is my influence.
Audience Member 
The word repetition features a lot in your expression. It seems like you’re
saying that life itself brings about a lot of repetitive movements and
thoughts and arrangements in life. So you’re trying to perceive life as such
and then you’re trying to go slightly beyond what everybody perceives to say, “There’s even more if you take time to think about life.” That’s my analysis of
your music. Can you confirm that?
Arturo Lanz 
Yeah, that’s right. The repetitive way of doing things, there’s a moment when
your mind is totally empty and you realize that something is no longer
repetitive. [laughs]
Audience Member 
Actually, you’re right. What makes music interesting is certain parts, either
rhythmically, or a motif repeats, or a tune that constantly repeats and then
it’s harmonised at some point to make the arrangement more interesting. I do
agree to you.
Emma Warren 
Thank you. Do we have any more questions?
Audience Member 
You said you don’t see your music as aggressive, maybe because you don’t make it
in an aggressive state. But maybe it’s the tones and the sounds people that would
see as aggressive. Is there any music out there that you do see as aggressive?
Even if it’s not something that traditionally aggressive to most people, what sounds
offensive to you? What is there about music that you just can’t stand? What do
you hate about some music?
Arturo Lanz 
I don’t hate any kind of music, but I don’t like the music with aggressive
messages against things. Before, yes, when I was listening, it was very good,
but not now. For example, these Nazi groups are awful. This music with racist
messages. It doesn’t matter about the music. The music is okay, but the message...
It’s very dangerous to deliver a message in a song. Even if it’s for peace or
it’s for hate. To give a message, the people who give this message, who are
they? A magician? Nothing is special. No one is special. Who are these people who sing about war?
Who are the Beatles? Who is John Lennon?
Audience Member 
Why should you listen to them?
Arturo Lanz 
It’s dangerous for me to give a message with music.
Emma Warren 
Have you always felt that way? Have you been that way for a long time?
Arturo Lanz 
Yes, a long time. Around 20 or 25 years.
Emma Warren 
Do we have any final questions? No. Well, before we go, I think perhaps could you play us
one more snippet from your new album? We’re going to be hearing you play live
tonight, isn’t it? Do you do any preparations before your live shows? You just go and
feel the power.
Arturo Lanz 
No preparation. Saverio does, but not me.
